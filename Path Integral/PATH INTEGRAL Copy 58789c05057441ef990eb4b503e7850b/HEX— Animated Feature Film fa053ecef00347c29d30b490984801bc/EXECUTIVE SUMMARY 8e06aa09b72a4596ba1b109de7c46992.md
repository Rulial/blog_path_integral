💡 [HEX—> Animated Feature Film](../HEX%E2%80%94%20Animated%20Feature%20Film%20fa053ecef00347c29d30b490984801bc.md)

Hex is a working title.

This is a beautiful story of the bond between an alien and two unlikely protagonists from the fictional city of Bombay, rising up against a mad billionaire who has the resources to obliterate them all.
 
The unlikely heroes in this story coupled with the sometimes gritty and sometimes posh environment its set in, which is the dichotomy of the city of Mumbai, is a deadly combination that has never been seen in the animation genre.
 
With successful movies like “Slumdog Millionaire” and “COCO” paving the path for the setting, HEX has great market potential as a theatrical release and as an early driver of the pipeline for high end content production to build the metaverse.

## DIRECTOR’S VISION

> I have always believed that all children are made same at birth. Sure, they are gifted in so many different ways, though, all of them have the capability to succeed in life if only we empower and help them to harness their hidden talents by providing equality of knowledge and resources.
> 

> This story comes from a personal experience when I was residing in South Bombay. Few kids living on the streets were trying to open a computer keyboard with a rock as I was walking towards the coast one evening and it just so happened that I had a screwdriver in my pocket at that time. I offered the screwdriver to those kids without saying anything and they instantly grasped its utility and threw away the rock.
> 

> I strongly believe the next stride in evolution would be man-made. It might come from any one of us or in fact many of us, therefore, we can’t afford to disregard anyone’s potential contributions to nature based on our inability to achieve the same level of equality in the past.
