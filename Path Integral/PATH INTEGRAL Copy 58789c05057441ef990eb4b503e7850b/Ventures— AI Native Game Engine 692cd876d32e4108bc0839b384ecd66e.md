    - Notes 📝
        
        I don’t represent anyone or anything other than myself 🤷‍♂️. No association with any group either. It’s only myself. “We” is used in the context of representing Path Integral, even though at the moment all this is a SOLOPENUER venture.
        
        1.0—> Nothing mentioned here is financial, personal or political advice by default—> kindly, use your own good wisdom before making any decisions along with consulting respective national or international institutions. 
        
        2.0—> Location preference. Hybrid, though happy to be in location for an agreed + set period of time anywhere in the world. Travelling and moving between places ✈️ as a tool for optimal performance—> happy to discuss custom arrangements.
        
        3.0—> When talking about technology + related aspects like economic models + anything product related—> nothing is a prophesy or a “no matter what” approach. Happy to talk with different stakeholders to figure things at different stages because that is how products are built. This does not mean indulging with anyone who thinks of themselves as “stakeholder.”
        
        4.0—> There are no centralised or decentralised limits to my movement, willing to happily co-operate without prejudice in finding solutions in case of any confusion. If no positive resolution can be reached, unlawful or unconstitutional restrictions will be challenged with applicable legal action.
        
        5.0—> Along with “rules of the human kingdom 🥰” I and by that effect Path Integral is respectful of national + international laws and regulations though also expect flexible, swift and solution led approach by counter parties.
        
        6.0—> Heard from someone gathering references that something about my experience listed on LinkedIn is not correct. Anyone who wants to challenge anything in there can write directly for a response with facts.
        
        7.0—> Colours anywhere on this portal don’t represent any ideology or anything else other than to manage attention. In fact, i don’t follow any ideology offline either, just saying because of the politics these days around the world. Most of my decisions online or offline are primarily based on humanistic values or capitalist concerns like how much money and time is in my pocket.
        
        8.0—> This page has nothing to do with fiction writing, therefore, nothing is coded with double or triple meaning and is definitely not representative of “the illuminati” lol. Incase, something seems too complicated to understand than ask questions as advised multiple times here rather than making assumptions and try to clean your own thinking.
        
        - Previously Learning/ Reading 👓
            
            —> Have been following the Deep Mind’s research for years to form a philosophical understanding for use in Narrative Writing though got into implementable AI last year after finding a base technical logic. Not a trained programmer but I have been self learning and running logic based experiments since the start of my career in VFX/ Computer Vision.

            On a continuous learning course of reading more than 200 papers/ documents for research—> Refining my intermediate knowledge of R, Python and other languages via single subject and detailed lessons of machine and deep learning on *Kaggle, Hugging face, Open AI* and other resources as a beginner.
            
            I don’t watch any videos tutorials to learn any particular subject and its fine those who do learn from watching video tutorials. Personally I find thinking, reading, writing and interactive applications as better learning techniques.
            
            Running Colabs of various demos put together by amazing researchers and programmers while working on original research you can find more about [here](Research%20Projects%E2%80%94%20Book%20looking%20for%20a%20publisher%205a29ceea5bf54f64a6d4dc6f91a60357.md) and as a short term side project also developing an adaptive Gen AI animation pipeline for [this](HEX%E2%80%94%20Animated%20Feature%20Film%20fa053ecef00347c29d30b490984801bc.md) among other potential use cases.

- ANNA + SOLO FAQ
    
    
    Feel free to ask your own questions directly via rohitb@path-integral.com or social media. This is where I try to feel important by asking all these questions of myself based on general feedback collected from the internet. You’re welcome.
    
    My versatile background can throw off some idiots or leave others unconvinced about the potential of this venture. Especially, upon reading fact based essay series herein—> [Words—> Long Form](Words%E2%80%94%20Long%20Form%20ed8500f5e08243f5b8796bfe35f8878d.md). Rest assured, this is not a movie venture. We are building this thing, failure is always a possibility, but at the same time, I am good at being objective. 
    
    1. “What do you think about Robotics?” 
        
        —> Robotics vary by domain. Manufacturing industry has been using different applications of robotics for a while contributing in safety and productivity, being a process driven domain. More efficient and better use of Robotics in manufacturing will only help society as its really a waste of human mind to watch over assembly line tasks—> it will open more creative roles as you would always need the human input.
        
        Humanoid robots on the other hand is an exciting tech but far from practical or useful and is more of an intrusive nuisance in day to day life which is already becoming too robotic. A self driving car is fine and useful as long as it works without problems on the road but you don’t necessarily want that in your living room or kitchen or bedroom or washroom.
        
        Also read—> [“What about jobs, doesn’t more AI means less jobs for humans?” ](Ventures%E2%80%94%20AI%20Native%20Game%20Engine%20692cd876d32e4108bc0839b384ecd66e.md) 
        
        And [“What are your thought re use of AI in military applications?”](Ventures%E2%80%94%20AI%20Native%20Game%20Engine%20692cd876d32e4108bc0839b384ecd66e.md) 
        
    
    1. “What are your thoughts about AI regulations?” 
        
        —> AI products can be regulated via open + transparent protocols though regulating research and development does not make any sense as they not only thrive but are only possible as open fields of curiosity. Unless, someone is looking to hand over all the advantage to incumbents or selective new comers, therefore, stalling long term progress for short term gains.
        
        Also, if you the reader for a second would think without contempt, offence and bias which is also known as open mindedness…..for a change—> have been constantly talking about building evolving protocols(plural) which is basically regulations but coded along with documentation, minus any hubris but audited for irregularities and cracks.
        
    
    1. “But many important people are worried about AI being a major threat.” I would like to keep this brief and non technical because when so many people are wrong there’s money in the answer though, this FAQ is not exactly “lucrative” —>
        
        
        Technically, there is NO WAY any current or future AI models will be able to initiate below scenarios ON ITS OWN in any capacity. Anyone suggesting otherwise is a fan of science fiction + a troll.
        
    
    As anyone can read in the Tweets/X’s, never have I said that AI does not pose any risks—> near future risks are quick generation and wide distribution of misinformation by human entities using this technology + social media. It would be really expensive to formulate such an coordinated attack which would also need to pass already established guardrails in every sector and domain—> extremely unlikely, difficult and expensive to say the least unless backed by a well equipped nation state. The usefulness and benefits of current AI development far out weighs these outlier risks.
    
    The global community is technically capable of taking measures to prevent this from becoming a wide spread phenomenon at any scale, just in case with protocols. Also, that we are not totally reliant on technology as a preventive measure, part of the solution is not-promoting mob thinking—> by the way.
    
    Many people also confuse unrealistic possibilities with developing capabilities or science with science fiction or over stating capabilities to create hype because hype brings attention for raising money. 
    
    Far future risk—> Use of AI for defence purposes and activities is already regulated and should be regulated. It’s not like just about anyone is capable of producing weapons in the real world. I would like to address this with technical details but in fact this would be much easier to tackle compared to the misinformation risk.
    
    Let’s forget the established guardrails and assume someone crazy is able to find all the hardware + software without anyone on earth having a clue and lets only consider advances in satellite surveillance using AI—> we would know if someone is building a huge army of Robots with super advanced AI before it becomes an actual or perceived threat of any kind, let alone an “extinction level threat.” None of the current development in Robotics are even close to these kind of capabilities. Again, none of this is executable by any AI system in labs or production on its own—> that’s science fiction. Those plot holes in movies are because they don’t actually have technical information even after spending hundred of millions and not only to maintain narrative pace along with seamless editing. Otherwise, everyone will make science fiction movies rather than producing research papers.
    
    It’s not like you can just put together a bunch of GPU’s to make music, movies or gaming content or statistical analysis of data or code apps for regulated App Stores but are actually ready to take over the entire Earth and also near by planets along with rest of the solar system. While at it, why not also conquer other galaxies, you know. WTF are we even talking about? 
    
    ChatGPT is not capable of such advances. There is no technical way for GPT of the future on any advanced mechanics of RLHF or even the most advanced algorithms currently out there to attain sentience. 
    
    There is no such switch that I or anyone on the internet knows of but then we also don’t know if UFO’s exists or not, either. The point being—> none of this sci-fi stuff has anything to do with based product development using machine learning and computer vision.
    
    Like I had mentioned at the beginning, all of the above and much more disinformation around this topic is provable technically as being only that. Will publish details in our official blog after starting.
    
    1. “What about jobs, doesn’t more AI means less jobs for humans?” 
        
        —> No, that is not true. We need to look at this in terms of technical capabilities, production and phases. 
        
        Structured and cyclical economies truly started with dawn of the industrial age. In comparison to the history of human civilisation, all of this is still quite recent though that does not mean we can or even afford to lose momentum due the problem in front of us like climate change but not only that. Everything is nature including us, everything that we do but to think we are directing the course of anything or protecting something is thinking too much of ourselves—> have you tried stopping time? 
        
        What is an economy? It’s multiple trade systems participating with each other in a monetary system primarily BASED and made to serve various requirements of human beings. For example, what would be an economy of a nation state without any population? If there is no demand then what is the need for supply for anything? A business can not build and sell on to itself. Netflix works because of the audience. iPhones are being used by real breathing people. Video games are popular among players. YouTube has an audience. Amazon has consumers. Jio has customers using SIM cards. Air India has passengers. Taj Mahal hotel hosts tourists and travellers. X / Instagram has users. Spotify has listeners. So on…all because of humans. 
        
        Capitalist economies are not spread evenly or fairly across the whole for both good and bad reasons but that does not mean they can sustain without people and for what? Again, it’s important to remember that economic structures came out of the need of the people to coordinate and not the other way around.
        
        Everything is inter connected to everything else based on needs and wants of human beings. To say any business can sustain or have even a cent worth of value without catering to human beings in some way, shape or form is saying that a tree can eat its own fruits. But that is not the case, as we know extremely well—> apples fall from the trees. That is not even a perfect analogy in this case but you get the point…i guess?
        
        If people won’t have jobs, if the consumer won’t have the purchasing power then who will the businesses sell to? How would they price things? Sure, things kinda got out of hands in terms of greed but we still have a good thing going here which will keep getting better with right use and better technology.
        
        It’s fun to work with other people, interact with clients, to turn strangers into friends, even after you have all kinds of securities, that is still a source of joy to keep going. I personally struggled with that question a while back thinking why am I doing what I am doing whether is making movies or building products—> the answer was to share with other people and it improved all my work.
        
        Current AI tools have immense scientific use case other than being useful for coding + related functions but are yet to become really useful products for everyday consumers. Productivity does not mean less work, it means getting more done with better quality as our efforts have better equity with thought and more agency with time = more opportunities.
        
        The future potential is abundance minus unnecessary friction for everyone on the planet without depleting the limited resources here on earth and AI is vital in fulfilling that promise. It’s software getting better which should not be confused with anything else because of hype or hysteria.
        
        Technical answer for properly tackling the challenges of AI are again evolving protocols. Not to say my solution is the only thing that will work, it might or might not but its progress in the right direction.
        
    2. “Why aren’t you ever absolutely certain of your proposed solutions?”
        
        —> Because to be absolutely sure of any proposed technology based solution or product before practical implementation along with market testing would be misguidance and technically naive. It’s called start-up and not “surely-up” for a reason. 
        
        Also, generally speaking—> Startups/ early stage ventures are not a matter of public opinion or unnecessary scrutiny, it isn’t supposed to make sense to just about anyone who knows nothing or has incomplete knowledge about the journey + micro or marco of the subject matter. Startups build products that are introduced to the public markets for judgement and tests.
        
    3. “Would you be interested in participating in a startup accelerator?” 
        
        —> Accelerators are amazing as conceived by Paul Graham and work for most startups in India, USA, UK and other countries. I encourage Startups to take that as priority route—> was also interested and even applied to few last year and another as fresh as some weeks ago. 
        
        It’s not about having no interest in a startup accelerator, but it just does not suite the trajectory of this venture. Nothing personal with anyone who runs a cohort. I’ld love being part of a community of intelligent and honest people, without this startup being part of the cohort.
        
        Accelerators are still welcome to have a conversation to directly invest in this venture.
        
        6 B. “How are you going to get the startup started without joining a cohort or accelerator or some narrative?”
        
        —> How about the good old “let’s stop beating around the bushes, put the narrative aside, cut the crap and come straight to the negotiation table?” 
        
        That’s how I like doing business and it’s a pretty effective way. Though, I am open to grants or fellowships with money upfront to get started or to write the book.
        
        Here’s my process if you want to give me a grant—> everything you want to know is already here—> you can contact me directly for specific queries—> then it’s up to you.
        
    
    1. “It sounds dangerous to open source AI models because of all the risks involved besides not being a profitable strategy or an efficient framework.”
        
        —> There are some misconceptions about open source and AI models out there. Most of the machine learning and computer vision projects, even the current most powerful models by Open AI and Deep Mind are fundamentally developed upon open source libraries like PyTorch and Keras Core. That’s just a fact. We are all building upon the life’s work of scientists and developers in this space as the only way to make progress in this field till recently was open source.
        
        For clarity, this means any progress made by anyone in this space is an improvement upon open source research and development. It’s like plugging a 🍅 from a field to make a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich but refusing to water the plant or not feeding grass to the 🐮 for using its milk. It’s not cool. It’s like wanting eggs from a 🐓 without feeding it. We are promoting 🐈 values which are proprietary to cats because they are so cute rather than human values which should be greater though, also include 🐕 values.
        
        Let’s be practical, you can keep the source code of your product closed as it takes significant resources to train current models and return on investment is a real thing but keeping the whole pipeline closed is not a long term growth policy.
        
        Let’s be real, training large scale powerful AI models that can be of concern are only possible with a lot of💰and there are present guardrails on hardware already in place to prevent recluse behaviour.
        
        It’s worth remembering, we are still extremely early in this whole thing to put research or development behind locked doors and the future in the hands of a select few. One constructive solution for AI development can be tangible open source + evolving protocols for efficient productivity to nurture RnD in science rather than relying on intangible ideals that can be taken for granted by greed or irrationality.
        
        Like with everything else, I am open to different views as even though a serious and urgent topic, it’s not something to argument over based on idealisms in place of practical solutions.
        
    2. “We don’t know enough about the project to invest at this stage. Are you trying to raise money based on vibes only?”
        
        > “We should invest in people not ideas. A good idea is often destroyed by bad people and good people can always make a bad idea better.” ~[Simon Sinek](https://quotefancy.com/simon-sinek-quotes)

        Hah…no, not calling myself good or bad, though it’s true that you should invest in people and not in ideas. If you don’t believe in my abilities and skills then there’s no point working together, anyways. I am looking to make art and money, for anyone who’s interested. By the way, there’s plenty of details available now about myself, and the project here on Notion. 
        
    3. “What’s a basic difference between your startup and 100’s of other AI startups with amazing track record building in this space?” 
        
        —> We’ll be building AI Native tools. Research for this startup has been focused on solving specific problems and shall be building tools with the purpose of making art for our own requirements which potentially opens up more functions with iteration rather than a general application. We are not an LLM based data automation company, though that’ll be one of the product features.
        
        Don’t have the specific text, though, think…Steve Jobs or Jony Ive spoke about how Apple builds software or hardware with the purpose of meeting end requirement for an individual—> this guides all of their design decisions. I have been using that little insight in doing almost everything.
        
    4. “Give us a rough initial roadmap.” 
        
        This is a roadmap, not account of every step. We shall also be building some custom hardware equipment + software with privacy and security concerns. This custom equipment will be only for internal development use, and not for sales. 
        
        Start writing ‘The Grand Loop’—> this shall start first and run in parallel, hopefully through a publisher, as a separate project.
        
        Upon getting the book deal, I’ll bootstrap the venture with part of that money. Bootstrap stage—> Build the SOLO Head Band prototype as the first order of business.
        
        Below are the major check points on this startup map.
        
        —> Start Parallel building ANNA, the game engine 
        
        —> Build the Grand 🍦 Loop game
        
        —> Release the open source + paid versions of the AI native game engine
        
        *** Please reach out If anyone has a better roadmap or wants to invest directly.
        
    
    1. “Are you building any hardware device?” 
        
        —> We will be building a SOLO ‘Head Band’ prototype only for myself to test. In time, it might evolve into a consumer device.
        
        - Additional Context
            
            Note that It’s a ‘Head Band’, and not a ‘Head Set.’ There are many ideas, but let’s say the primary idea is being on the right side of privacy, and transparency. 
            
            The data in your head belongs to you by default, unless you choose to share it. Everything else is an additional super features on top of that basic purpose.
            
        
    2. “Why not build on GPT4, Claude, Llama or whatever model Google Deepmind is going to release? According to some controlled studies LLM’s are quite formidable and capable of many important tasks. It seems rather unwise to not build on readymade LLM’s or Multi Modals.”
        
        —> Not building a chatbot. Based on extensive practical testing various AI text and voice chat bots, I advise people having conversations with other people, animals, trees, wind, water or themselves, rather than with a computer, at least for now. Tree is a word, but tree is also a living thing. You can train a vision model to learn 100 different types of trees and use LLM’s to articulate that knowledge with autoregressive next word prediction—> is that intelligence, though? It’s mostly labelling, classification and patterning without any emotional or thought construct from already available information relayed in context of imprecise prompts. FYI, I don’t have anything readymade which is better or worse other than having different requirements that makes it more viable to not build on readymade solutions.
        
    
    12.B What is even the point of working in AI when Open AI backed by Microsoft is focused on building AGI? If not them then it’ll be Anthropic and Google Deep Mind is always there with the most talented people in the whole world. It needs massive investment to even exist in the same space, forget competing with them you puny scoundrel!”
    
    —> Correct. I am just writing a book for enjoyment of the readers and building video games for fun. Not competing with anyone, why and how?! There’s no point at this stage.
    
    1. “Are you still working on AGI/ A?!/ ASI?”
        
        —> No.
        
    2. “Is this some kind of story app using generative AI to make videos?”
        
        —> lol, no. There are already many wonderful Startups working on the product mentioned in the question. We don’t do FOMO stuff in this company.
        
        - Additional Context
            
            FOMO full form—> ‘fear of missing out.’
            
        
    3. “B2B or B2C”
        
        —> The product is being made for individual use but enterprise can also find it useful.
        
    4. “Does this project have anything to do with Crypto, Consumer Finance/ Fin Tech?”
        
        —> Not at the moment. Also, nothing to do with gambling, play to earn or financial services. Might incorporate some financial instruments later.
        
    5. “What’s the product domain?”
        
        —> We will be building a game engine, thats the core product with extensions in multiple domains. If you don’t realise that gaming industry itself needs to level up and that will be useful in other domains then I have nothing to say to you! 🎮
        
    6. “Why are you in such hurry?”
        
        —> Why are you not?!
        
    7. “What is Citizen0?”
        
        AI can be used to build more transparent and better governance models rather than only being deployed at interface or application or media layer. Citizen0 open source project will be a head start for anyone wanting to build in that realm.
        
    8. “We would like to get clarity on a few issues.”
        
        —> You are requested to kindly follow these [guidelines](Ventures%E2%80%94%20AI%20Native%20Game%20Engine%20692cd876d32e4108bc0839b384ecd66e.md) to make direct contact for absolute clarity.
        
    9. “What makes you so excited about building AI first product in the mentioned domains and what do you bring to it?”
        
        —> It can be difficult for some people to grasp but along with technical familiarity with the technology and science of AI, I primarily bring a film directors essence to every subject—> which is not generally appreciated because there’s nothing general about it, that’s how I approach everything. The wonderful things we will be able to build with AI to share with the world is truly exciting.
        
    10. “What are you doing in btw, till this Startup gets going?”
        
        —> Continuing with reading, thinking and writing, generally + about topics based around AI + tech in limited capacity as the technical details of the venture are stealth. Also, managing my own social media with the purpose of promoting this startup and the book along with other work related opportunities, which is a full time job for many people + organisations and a lot of hard work reading, liking content day/ night. 
        
        For sure, this kind of AI Startups usually take a different route to attract investors, but who says we need to do things based on a template? I was really tired of doing everything in stealth when developing movie scripts, it’s better to be out there in terms of the approach, and let people approach us, rather than the other way around. As mentioned, actual details are still stealth—> but, ancillary work and myself are open + approachable.
        
        You can’t do all this inside a vacuum either, therefore, quite natural to talk about current or not so current things. Since, I do everything with complete dedication and focus, it’s a 24x7 mission to accelerate.
        
    11. “Doesn’t your idea need market validation? You aren’t special, you know?!”
        
        —> Products need market validation. Ideas need to be built. Also, a technical product is different from a product based on innovating mechanics of trade. For example, there’s little point in extensively brain storming sales and marketing strategy for an electric car if you have not already built an electric car and before anyone asks—> no, we are not building electric cars.
        
    
    1. “Aren’t you tired of writing FAQ’s?”
        
        —> Yes, totally, but you gotta do what you gotta do! I don’t like writing FAQ’s, therefore, it’s a lot of hardwork.
        
    2. “What could be the reason for some people underestimating and other overestimating AI capabilities?”
        
        —> It’s a side effect of the Information age, facts get lost among opinions because only few can profit from facts whilst many do from opinions—> a negative but also a positive 🤷‍♂️
        
        iPhone/ Smart Phone is like the sub era of the Information age, many things came together in the app ecosystem which based on variable proximity to an actual solution leads to different estimations by experts or non experts.
        
        AI is peculiar as being an expert in making apps does not makes you an expert in the science to make AI first products by default which is not a dig on anyone.
        
    3. “You think philosophy can be useful in building AI first products? Ha…..ha…ha”
        
        —> No subject/ branch of knowledge exists in a vacuum of its own even if it once did in the early days of science. Also, it depends on the background and skilzs of the person approaching a problem to bring different pieces together for building useful products. We can’t have ready made solutions for anything not made out of readymade solutions, therefore, the most important research skill is objectively looking for a solution and hopefully finding it!
        
    4. “Why don’t you build something to solve a real problem?”
        
        —> Let me give you a classic example about this issue to drive the point home and it’s called the iPhone, that also inspired Android smart phones. Almost every consumer facing technology today is running as an app through a smart phone. In turn spiralling into multi million or billion dollar businesses themselves, Uber for example was not predicted when Steve Jobs launched the thing in 2007.
        
        Air India started as a fun project because JRD Tata was interested in flying planes and became one of the primary airlines of the world. Most development in computer science has been led by gaming enthusiasts and so on. Flying human beings was classified as not being a real problem back in the early 1900’s but how much of the business and activities does it drive around the world? It’s difficult to think about a world without airplanes. Satellites orbiting around earth was a science fiction concept at first before it became a reality, now helping solve all kinds of problems in various important domains including communication and agriculture.
        
        There are several examples of technologies or projects starting as fun which did not seem like a serious problem at the time but ended up solving real problems or opening new avenues for the general pubic. Compare that to businesses that are started with the propaganda of solving serious problems to secure funding or valuation or status though end up solving absolutely nothing but also being actually funny.
        
    
    1. “What are your thought re use of AI in military applications?”
        
        —> The following is said in the context of my personal views which are based in unconditional peace for all of humanity and does not necessarily or fully reflect my general + professional understanding of geo politics. This is also not any kind of statement on history. Already wrote about the risk of AI here [“But many important people are worried about AI being a major threat.” I would like to keep this brief and non technical because when so many people are wrong there’s money in the answer though, this FAQ is not exactly “lucrative” —>](Ventures%E2%80%94%20AI%20Native%20Game%20Engine%20692cd876d32e4108bc0839b384ecd66e.md) 
        
        Not having any wars or armed conflicts would be so much better but we don’t live in an ideal world. I don’t have deep understanding of defence sector / domain and have no interest in violent conflicts either, though, publicly available information suggests various countries developing automated weapon systems—> auto pilot in Air Planes has been available forever but still not perfect and still developing as the most mundane example. 
        
        If the future is a bunch of non sentient robots squaring it off so that we don’t lose the brave soldiers anywhere on earth, well that sounds great. It always makes more sense to talk and figure things out, just saying that advancement in technology might lead us more towards that future 🤷‍♂️. The point here being about balance of power which is important to make diplomacy work and not a prediction or comment about defence requirements of any nation state. There are 8 billion people on earth with even more diversity if that could be counted in numbers, of course there will be conflicts and open minded flexibility is important/ vital to peacefully coexist but also to progress.
        
        This is an extremely naive answer to this question because that’s the level of my personal disinterest in developing weapons of any kind. I love unconditional peace and diplomatic solutions—> more conferences, festivals, conventions and less wars! 🤍
        
    2. “What do you think of Quantum Computing? Also, do you want to transition to that?”
        
        If anyone understands Quantum Physics as much as anyone can + basic computing to high end use cases then it’s pretty self explanatory. I have read few research papers and a bunch of blogs though have never actually come across or used an actual working or non working quantum computer. Therefore, it would be pretty naive to comment as computers are supposed to work in practice, not in theory—> at the moment its like someone has put a quantum car together attached to magic horses though it’s anyones guess if they are going to be pulling it or not?! Quite early, i am not worried of being left behind in the quest to own a quantum computer or anything like that. To be honest, I am not worried of being left behind in anything other than love and kindness.
        
        Sure. Though, transition to quantum computing does not keeps me awake at night and is not really part of any specific plans. I mean…..’we will see what happens’ is the most sensible thing to say in this regard. I can’t even buy a candy right now of my own, you know?
        
        Rough plan is to build the product, start generating revenue and then analyse.
        
    3. “Out of 🍦 or 🎮 what do you want to do first?”
        
        —> Simultaneously, because they are inter dependent. The “plan” with the startup is to begin lean + small rather than spending boat loads of money which means having the flexibility to onboard investors who align with the long term vision while achieving short term product and sales goals. This would also leave enough room to complete the book and have a personal life. It’s important to control our own pace as a startup, rather than being unnecessarily pushed around.
        
    4. “AI is a sensitive topic with lot of Geo Politics involved. What are your views about this? Also, explain your position re China”
        
        —> I have no geo political interests, personally or professionally. That would be really funny if I did. I have been following multiple governments to understand their current governance models from Japan to Argentina, and how it will affect their future AI policies. It’s important to follow global political discourse as there’s a lot of misinformation re AI policy, one nation’s or union’s policy can effect others. AI is also related to every domain in the world whether financial trade or movement of goods, you have to keep a wide and broad view to construct business models. Again, it’s more to be future ready when we have to deal with such issues in practical capacity for sales.
        
        Personally or professionally I will follow the foreign policies and advice of resident country most likely to be USA, India, UK or UAE. Whether it’s AI or otherwise. 
        
        In case of any conflict between India and China/ any other south Asian Country, i will only hope for a peaceful resolution with good trad ties, though, would always take 🇮🇳 India’s side. That’s not a debate.
        
        China has a communist political system which really bothers me and I don’t see myself ever living there. Had been intrigued for the purpose of writing fiction but that was also to highlight its position in the world economics while still being somewhat of a secretive culture. I respect the people of all countries including China and want to provide no further thoughts on its politics as it’s none of my business.
        
        In full transparency—> I had a business partner who is originally from Mumbai, India but based in Beijing, China with his wife. Though, he came back to India when the pandemic started. Him being my business partner was a co incidence as we used to work together for an American VFX company in Mumbai, India 2007-2008. It’s funny to call him my business partner as we never had any transaction or monetary exchange. I have never been to China personally either. 
        
        I wrote a fiction screenplay in 2011 which had Chinese people as characters in India or New York depending on the draft, based on information collected from Google search results or facebook posts or general internet. The story was to highlight privacy concerns with tech being part of our everyday life and China’s dominance in electronic manufacturing leading into digital and putting them in a position to take unfair advantage. Which we can see playing out with TikTok. I can’t advocate for anything to be banned in good conscience but don’t care and can’t be bothered with Geo politics.
        
        Other story was loosely based on an article published in some Indian News Paper about a Cab Driver making fool out of an American Tourist by telling him that it’s a civil war in the city for extra fare. I took that basic premise and tried to build the whole world around by including probability theories and whatnot. I always want to tell stories that can have a global appeal, therefore, tried to base that story in Beijing playing on the Hollywood — China dynamics in context of a driver being able to make fool of a tourist due to unfamiliarity with with the local language. The whole film was based in a car, though, in India majority of digital + physical communication is in English so it didn’t seem like a viable story unless the protagonist was a total fool. Also, there was a lot of funding available at that time from Chinese film companies and everyone in the world was going for it. But ended up writing a draft based in Mumbai. No one bought the screen play, it never went anywhere much but you never know, once you do well things change and old stuff can get picked up.
        
        - Additional Comments
            
            Heard chatter on some corner of the Internet about trolls trying to decipher people’s ideology based on the colours or figuratively anything interacted with on a daily life—> it’s complete idioticness and arguments of absolute fools. There are limited colours in the spectrum which are used everywhere and an individual has no control over how a brand chooses to represents themselves. What can you do? Go around asking people to change colours all around so that idiots looking to make a buck by spreading rumours can be satisfied?! Anyone choosing brand colours to represent an ideology is stupid with corrosive intentions. I don’t choose colours based on ideology of anything but for the natural feel and ART of it. Not a debate.
            
        
    5. “What’s the 🍦 book about? Will anyone able to read it to make their own AI?”
        
        —> Contents of the book have nothing to do with building AI, specifically. As such, this is not your typical AI book concerning “the brain with the machine” but to take you on a trip of a lifetime. Useful in more ways than you can imagine before reading or playing 😅
        
    6. “Are you building Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality based product?”
        
        —> NO. Not making a product focused on either Virtual or Augmented Reality. Might venture into Augmented Reality at some point in the future though too early to claim anything like this. 
        
        Everyone developing Virtual or Mixed reality is doing important work, especially the hardware as that still needs lot of development so that anyone can use a headset/ glasses/ eye contraption like a smart phone or a laptop.
        
        Don’t think Augmented Reality is as simplistic as making nice glasses with the best features. AR + AI would make human interaction with the digital world much more natural—> My basic principle of developing augmented reality is immersive + indulging without the intrusiveness of always wearing glasses or putting on a headset which is not easy at all in terms of both hardware + software.
        
    7. “You should get a Co Founder?”
        
        —> Sure, I can go to the markets and just buy one…..eh?
        
        while its good if this happens to be the case, it should not be a forced connection. Having a co founder is like finding a life partner, over engineering doesn’t lead to great results, especially in terms of the start up. It’s better to elevate early employees to a co founder annotation if that helps to accelerate and make best use of time. Investors would love this as it mitigates risk by not putting all their chips on a solo founder—> template/formulaic thinking can be useful in generalised cases, though not always.
        
    8. “There will be a board of directors, of course?”
        
        —> Yes, thats fine. We can discuss and figure out a structure that works.
        
    9. “You have no professional experience in building AI first products. We would rather prefer to invest in those who have worked for Apple or Google or Microsoft or Tesla or Meta or some other tech giant.”
        
        —> No one has experience building a truly AI first products but everyone is trying to do their best. Just saying. Many people have vast experiences in machine learning or computer vision which is great and am looking forward to working with those people in this startup. If everyone has similar experience, style or capacity of learning then we will end up with same things while innovation breeds from a slightly different point of view. I have confidence in my technical research logic and execution based on logic which also prevents overconfidence. That’s why not jumping into something completely left field like healthcare, but motivated by interest in gaming and the potential to eventually/ hopefully have a positive impact on other fields.
        
    10. “Where do you want the company to be based out of?”
        
        —> Ideally? It’s important to be primarily based in a place with least amount of political, religious or general fanaticism to save time and focus on the work.….. New York, New York or SF 🇺🇸 seem ideal in that regard or Netherlands 🇳🇱 , also in terms of access to tech + talent from all around the world. London 🇬🇧 is a potential candidate as many AI research outfits are already based there.
        
        39 B. Why not start this up in India🇮🇳 itself?
        
        —> If this was a startup focused primarily on the consumer market from the onset, then it would make sense to be based in India. However, that is not the case at this time, and there are other concerns which can not be mentioned here. This is not about nationalism, but positioning. 
        
        I am from India, and by default have an unbreakable connection, it’s difficult to say anything without raising a cent, but we might have a second office here in the future. Also, I have definite plans of setting up this [Dharma Initiative—> Not For Profit](Dharma%20Initiative%E2%80%94%20Not%20For%20Profit%206eba6bb8f373425f8223e58e406cc42a.md) in India from origin. It won’t be too far into the future.

            I love public dealings, but not dealing with fanatic idiots because you can not reason with such people. Also, most fanatics are hypocrites controlled by those with power or money. Looking into the future, we don’t want to be based in any such extremely polarised + manipulative environments. Otherwise, it’s just total waste of time and energy. There are all types of people everywhere, intelligent people you can reason with or those you can’t reason with at all, I want to able to reason with those working with or around me, rather those who can be manipulated by just about anything.
            
        
    11. “Won’t it be better to be based out of a less expensive place?”
    
    —> All major cities in the world are expensive in a similar range. Focus, peace and best performance are more important.
    
    1. “What is the one thing you expect if someone wants to work with you?”
        
        —> HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY. That is the foundation of good communication.
        
    2. “Aren’t you trying to do many things? Should focus on one thing.”
        
        —> That’s topic of the day thinking without knowing the subject. The 🍦 and 🎮 are the only two things being worked upon to start, both are separate but connected in essence that one is relaxing exercise for the mind, which on a given day could be either. Focus is not sitting and looking at the needle but the ability to move it. Go back to the school kids. Also, welcome to The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy, if you don’t get the reference [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)
        
    3. “Is there some expectation of privileged treatment.”
        
        —> How come? Not asking for a private jet or helicopter to fly me to NYC or from there to anywhere else or a condo on the top floor of The Empire State Building or Bhurj Khalifa or insert name of the city you like. Reading what you want to read because it suits a certain narrative is an age old problem with cynical and pessimistic people. 
        
        I had mentioned risk of AI disinformation being a problem in Nov 2022 based on research along with probable measures as much as I could share for free on social media. 
        
        To startup or write a book or any work or performance is not a privilege or a trophy but a responsibility to deliver unless you are in a crony professional culture. The whole point of a startup is orientation to results compared to any other form of academic setup and being cent/paisa/penny to cent/paisa/penny productive. 
        
        Among major concerns of academic or corporate institutions should be to not become like a political party because they have a different arena to play and those dynamics are best suited in there.
        
        “But there are PHD’s entitled to find progress or breakthroughs.”
        
        Start your own start up then, who’s stopping them?! These guys did—> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google)
        
        But if you want comfort of an established institution where results don’t really matter that much though managing expectations or getting enraged then nothing wrong with that either. I get it, it’s totally fine. You do you, I do whatever the heck I like. That is not to say my way is better or worse but with an intention to deliver.
        
        Last thing I think of doing on any given day is discouraging someone from doing anything, especially when they seem to be good + passionate. Therefore, I don’t get all the talk down mentality.
        
        Don’t care if anyone thinks doing what you are good at and getting paid for that is a privilege because they could never believe in themselves. Keep it real 🥂
        
    4. “Define early adopters for this product.”
        
        —> Read the rough roadmap above. Early adapters will be game and AI developers, either individuals or organisations. We will also have Open Source projects to get people started.
        
    5. “You will be directly competing with well established products like Unreal Engine and Unity among many other open source options.”
        
        —> We can compete based on engineering and design in this product category. The work is cut out and going to be difficult though if we can build a product that’s exponentially better at building games then strategy and politics of getting to the market are relatively easier concerns.
        
    
    1. “Why is the product called ANNA?”
    
    —> It’s the name of my favourite artist and person apart from being a palindrome, so that’s already awesome in every way possible!
    
    1. “What’s your believability of seeking trust to build this while basically being a loser?”
        
        —> I have been working on this problem since 2011 while constantly upgrading myself without giving up. Even before getting into VFX, i wanted to build games so it’s not something completely random. To some pompous jerk that might seem like loosing, to me it’s always felt like preparing. Started with interest in spatial computing/ AR and you can read everything on the pages here to gauge the research based insights on AI. 
        
        Also, I am building something extremely difficult, but practical that can be iterated on rather than proposing something that can be “quickly popular” for market effect. Therefore, I don’t really understand the “grab and run” kinda diagnosis which seems rather unfair, far fetched and absolutely silly—> anyone with such concerns is not only mistaken, but is also a bad judge of character or spreading deliberate malice.
        
        Same with the book—> I never wanted to write a book, thats a completely different ball game from writing movie scripts or essays, and i was not much of an essay writer either till recently. Like everything else, I take upon projects based on curiosity and interest, felt this is something that can be shared with the world and needs to be in a book format to begin with and develop further into other formats.
        
        I have another couple of idea for fiction books ‘Learning to Laugh’ and ‘Nothing to do with me” which is much more easier, but not pushing at this time because🍦makes more commercial sense.
        
    2. “Would you consider doing something else and wait on this to start in a while?”
        
        —> No. Why would I do that? That makes no sense at all. I don’t make any decision lightly or without considerable amount of thinking from every possible angle. I am unemployable, not because I can’t do anything else, but because this is what I can do best, so, why shouldn’t I do the best possible thing? Both the book and building the game engine are exciting projects, there’s no reason to delay either. Ready to START.
        
    
    1. “Sure you don’t have the money, but why don’t you have a hamster schedule?”
        
        —> Because you should only keep an hamster schedule when you are trying to accomplish something that can be achieved by keeping a hamster like schedule. Otherwise, you are unnecessarily restricting your thought process into an hamster pattern that is useful for accomplishing only certain types of tasks while leaving you unprepared for deep thinking scientific or artistic work. It’s never about accomplishing the schedule but accomplishing the task. For example—> to ideate a piece of fiction or doing deep logical work you don’t necessarily need to sit in a place constantly. But when you are done with the rough work and ready to implement with the resources than minimum 8 hours a day become essential, if you are truly motivated with a burning passion than it looks more like 18 hours of custom + modular hamster schedule.
        
    
    1. “You post so much stuff on social media without any traction, do you want to become an influencer?”
        
        —> I don’t mind a stream of revenue till we can get started with this venture and then manage on the side. Though, it’s not so much about becoming an “influencer” but to keep sharing mindfulness and insights to help the people + also helping them build a better understanding of associated subjects.
        
    2. “Are you building a content business rather than a tech business or both? It’s bound to fail!”
        
        —> We will be building as advertised. What do you do with a game engine if not build games?! Unreal Engine was made to build Unreal Tournament and so on. John Carmack started with the intention of building a game and not a game engine. We are not building Pixar because there’s more long term commercial sense in building the tech while it made sense for Pixar to sell the movies. Calm down.
        
    3. “Considering you have no money, will you use the money invested in the company primarily for personal use?”
        
        —> Sorry?! Even though the project is named Anna, the money is being raised to build the game engine and not for my wedding. lol. If you are a professional investor then you know how this works—> all the cards can’t be in your pocket.
        
        It’s a long term project with incremental goals. I can do 1000000 things like only writing the book and becoming an influencer while doing other stuff for an easy life but I like challenges, and have put in last 2 years doing specific research on these subjects other than doing soft research for several years prior. That does not mean I want to live hand to mouth for satisfaction of someone’s perception about “how a startup founder should conduct his personal life.” It says nowhere that eating only once a day will make the game engine better than if my family eats 3 times a day or however my lifestyle looks like.
        
        Such naive rubbish is for the non curious, non intelligent or non objective. I am only addressing this because internet is filled with such concerns of investors who care more about perception than the product when it’s all about keeping the balance.
        
        Neither the startup or the book are vehicles to drive “my personal brand.” Not that kind of startup, I am not that person, if you have that perception and you don’t directly communicate to correct yourself then you are not the person I want to work with either. No denying, these projects will contribute towards ‘the personal brand’ aspect if found helpful and useful by people, but you also have to respect the massive risk factor involved.
        
        It’s not even like “oh it’s a shiny new thing daddy will help fund.” It has never been that easy and thank goodness! 
        
        - Additional Context
            
            I love Anna Chukova, and want to spend my life with her, still a real person who also does not have vast or any resources, rather than choosing to “marrying well for the money.” Don’t really see or understand whats the scam?!
            
        
    4. “What would be the core improvement and impact of your product?”
        
        —> Stealth. Talk to me.
        
    5. “We are a black box with huge investment to manufacture semiconductors in a country previously not known to build any but it will take time to get going so we want to wait before engaging or making investments in startups, if any. I am also 86 years old with not many great advisors around me when it comes to tech or startups. What should I do under these circumstances?”
        
        —> Time is an illusion sir and we don’t have any. You cannot wait for this to start, that to finish…thats precious time wasted which could be used in actual product development and relevant feedback loops rather than deliberating about the righteousness of things. Parallel development, thinking and computing are all highly effective techniques that are need of the hour not only in computing but also in decision making. How things look should be the least of your concerns compared to how things might turn out in case right decisions are not made at the right time including valuing other people’s time. Your investment in this could strengthen your position in the semi conductor side of things while not indulging with this is a slope easily projected on its usual trajectory. 
        
    
    1. “Explain the risk to tech consultancies, please.” 
        
        —> As you would know, most of the tech consultancies are built upon engineering talent and proven track record of implementing solutions at scale, made on third party software and infra rather than core tech competencies. 
        
        It’s a servicing business more like Advertisement agencies rather than tech companies and that means fragile to change, dependent upon retention of skilled talent and client looking for safety rather than adventure like Banks or Railways while always chasing to integrate foundational technologies that others are building. Even the websites of some known tech consultancies won’t get approval from me, even for a low paying client, it’s all buzz words and template designs executed like an after thought rather than serving useful function.
        
        The client limited in their understanding of tech is looking for a reliable name to off load the responsibility in case shit hits the roof, internal management have a marketable name to blame—> “we chose this vendor because of their 30 years of work in this domain” or someone who can always send more manpower to stabilise a vulnerable situation. I kinda grew up around tech servicing business and then worked most of my life in that even when not being paid well lol…to understand the fundamentals inside out!
        
        Tech consultancies neither have the talent or the bandwidth or organised for the kind of research required to compete with companies like Open AI or Anthropic or Google or Tesla in their domain. Sure, you can use compatible open source solutions but engineering hacks are not going to make much difference when your foundation model can’t compete with the best. 
        
        It’s not only about automating engineering but fundamental change in your relationship with software itself and like everything else, comes down to cost. It will no longer be like “everyone is building on this stack” or “how much more you can get out of C++ or python even if you are an OG coder.” Your code dependencies are going to be much larger on AI providers like Open AI/ Microsoft or Tesla for self driving cars than lets say Autodesk for use of their software. Let’s not even get started with complexities of Data acquisition. 
        
        Large consultancies will have smaller advantages which would lead to break away teams or new consultancies or better equipped internal teams altogether offering similar solutions to previously susceptible clients—> thats just talking short term like what can happen in 10 years. Hiring talent will also change as much as servicing clients. Tech consultancies much like the advertisement industry might ultimately become a game of Mergers & acquisitions.
        
        Based on the above, we can ascertain that an empire largely based on market value of a consultancy is vulnerable and at risk in the long term. Unless, you invest in developing core competencies in AI which can’t be done under the organisational structure of a consultancy, therefore—> startups.
        
        It’s one thing to be a manufacturing facility for semi conductors and another to compete with ASML or Nvidia, you probably can’t. You are competing on location value which is highly susceptible to Geo politics. More and more affordable locations with low cost labour will be coming up other than India, like Mexico or Indonesia in the present and Africa in the near future. Therefore, other than being vulnerable to political upheaval, margins are low there as well even with a growing local market. It’s more long term survival than thriving.
        
        For example—> if you are wholly dependent upon a previous operation in another country to teach you how to achieve compatible performance as a manufacturing unit for a well paying global client, thats a pretty low bar for internal RnD competency.
        
        Other option might be to slowly off load market cap dependence away from the tech consultancy and software businesses as a whole but that won’t be ideal and obviously a step back.
        
        Hopefully, that’s helpful 🙏🏾
        
    2. “The truth of the matter is that people will keep saying they are interested and posting inspiring gibberish, but rather invest in someone who has worked for Google or Microsoft even if they have not contributed anything worthwhile or they have maybe or someone with no clue but an ass kisser with enough to make it “look good.” The point is most VC’s are not sure of themselves to take an actual risk of reputation or money, their curiosity is limited to their insecurities. How will you navigate this problem?!“
        
        —> this is tough. I can’t do much in this case other than what I have been doing. There are many concerns about just putting the work out there without any incentives and if you could make this without any money then why would I even want VC money?! It’s not a trophy or a gold medal to take investment from someone but a grave liability and a risk itself because you never know about their intentions, the venture could suffer because of bad investors, more than bad employees because you can always fire someone who works for you and its really complicated to fire an investor at any stage but especially at pre seed or seed stages. It’s mostly about connecting with someone sensible and my email is open for direct communication.
        
        That’s another reason I am raising a really balanced figure with solid built in incentives. Once, we are out there with some form of the intended product then it won’t be a problem to raise money from insecure and unsure investors either.
        
    3. “Why don’t you just start building in open source itself and things will work out on their own, they always do! It’s like a movie!”
        
        —> It’s nothing like a movie. Building an AI first game engine is not your usual computer science curry that can come together with a community hard at it. We are also not building some communal IT park where the whole point is to bring in more crowd. Those are not the recipes that work in this case. Everything has its own patterns and organisational principles, it’s better to start in stealth and then open source it at the right time + stage. There’s plenty of evidence out there of projects starting open source from origin and not on the best of trajectories as we speak, it’s fine they tried and learned, but I am not here to knowingly repeat other people’s errors. I read to get better and have a better plan.
        
    4. “What incentive do human beings have in developing AI if it’s going to replace them at some point?”
        
        —> AI is never going to replace human beings, period—> I have a technical explanation for this thesis which I am happy to share in exchange for money. 
        
        Life on earth just like the rest of the universe is a not a static affair, if we don’t advance and adapt then we are as good as the dinosaurs. It might not be apparent if you analyse that from your narrow perspective but quite obvious from a multi perspective wide view over a lengthy timeline. Even with all the advances in tech, human race is still vulnerable to asteroids. Sure, we can try some things mostly for our own amusement but does current tech guarantee survival? Nope. Don’t look up.
        
        What about climate change? Nope, we have no real answers as of yet other than macro economic, cultural or political posturing. Solar power is not replacing Oil, carbon levels are not reducing, temperatures will rise above 1.5 Celsius by 2050 as sure as tomorrow is Monday. It’s not for the lack of intention but lack of scientific solutions in every domain thats convincing enough for a general consensus to change. All you need to do is go talk to the corner shop, they don’t even believe climate change is a real threat or that plastic is bad—> I rest my case. Don’t look down.
        
        Everything in the universe along with the universe itself is constantly moving and changing. Technological advances are not only about being fancy or earning big incentives which is just part of the process but survival over a long term period as a specie. It’s fine to not care about all this or to take it too seriously but at least don’t promote your negative mindset without reasonable arguments. Dream 🙂
        
    5. “We are still not convinced. Can we see some lines of code?”
        
        —> If you are not convinced, that’s totally your problem, not mine. There’s nothing I can do other than building as advertised here rather than do gymnastics to convince you that I can win boxing gold medal in the olympics.
        
        If your argument is based in cynicism or pessimism to my actual insight on the subject matter then thats already a bad point to start a discussion.
        
        In terms of the code, we need to get there unless you want to see the same code that every other gaming engine uses? or some hack of open source LLM’s? or some magic code that can do anything? Once we start building, there will be plenty of code and iterations. You are only repeating the set filtration pattern in your head which is not applicable in this case.
        
        The whole world is apparently moving towards natural language programming because of developments in artificial intelligence but my insights in natural language are not enough for you to invest in an AI first game engine? What kind lousy argument is this? You should commission the 🍦 book so it can help you think better as a first order of business, maybe?
        
    6. “How can you mitigate risks of an angel investor at this stage?
        
        —> Based on all the factors + metrics 😉 —> Commission the book—>[Research Projects—> Book looking for a publisher](Research%20Projects%E2%80%94%20Book%20looking%20for%20a%20publisher%205a29ceea5bf54f64a6d4dc6f91a60357.md) —> 50% of that will be automatically invested into building the game engine as angel investment.
        
        You can earn both from sales of the book + equity in the venture initially as an angel investor.
        
        The above deal is not a necessity or an ideal situation, its preferable to find separate deals with a publisher for the book and an angel investor for the game engine. 
        
        However, the situation being what it is, combining both projects into one deal is to provide maximum available cushion for the incoming partners.
        
        The idea of building the game based on the ice cream cone book is organic and not done from a financial perspective. That, in fact was the adjacent point which lead to putting together this proposed deal.
        
        Happy to discuss a different or better deal.
        
    7. “How did you got working on this project?”
        
        —> I have been keeping up with the domain of AI for a long long time but never went into technical development myself until mid 2022 because of a job opportunity at Open AI which I did not get. However, I had hit a comfort level with the science of AI by reading and evaluating enough research papers to connect the dots in a meaningful way to give up. Maybe, it was years of accumulated insights on various subjects finding a specific purpose of being able to build something meaningful rather than just another app or service. It’s not about narratives like I was writing movies or side jobs as a glorified clerk or VFX Guy or technology consultant, therefore, it “looks awkward” to jump into this or that or the AI game—> The important thing being that I always kept my standards high and kept on learning. Narratives only matter in cinema or content and are forced upon people in reality. 
        
        There’s a lot of diverse technical knowledge, you compound through each of those roles if looking to constantly improve rather than cashing out with every opportunity.
        
    8. “What is an advantage of investing in this venture compared to investing in an applied AI SAAS Startups?”
        
        —> You won’t be indirectly working for Microsoft or Google or AWS is a good enough reason. This is a stand alone project that won’t be dependent on legacy tech giants for them to pull the rug out without notification. Other than Deep Mind, most current useful foundation models have come out of the same cohort and that’s vulnerability of the ecosystem to be relied upon couple of entities for core development.
        
        This is a profound question because unlike a programming language where you can show engineering chops to gain advantage in performance, developers are completely reliant on these models for output. Sure, you can use RAG’s and whatnot to stitch things together but with no real alternate options for output. It will look nothing like the saas business model.
        
        How big is the market for fake media? Because thats pretty much where everything is headed for revenue and still a human being wanking at the other end, i guess one wanker at a time is how AI “takes over” the world?! It looks more like Only Fans take over of the world is imminent, i have never used it by the way 🤷🏾‍♂️
        
        I like Satya, Bill and Steve Ballmer 😁 pubic personas as I don’t know them personally, but have to take some organisation as an example, what to do?! So, you think they will make an AI powered laptop and the AI on this laptop will direct you to an app made by a third party developer, by the way using the same AI model, rather than handling the query itself?! Sure, maybe take a course in capitalism and business models of big corporations while you are at it. Nothing like SAAS. AI Pin or Meta Glasses and obviously ‘Apple Watch’ have a better chance of competing.
        
        When the foundation models are more AI and less automation, the data centre or no of GPU’s would matter based on the scale of the problem rather than needing 100 acres and 1 million GPU’s to output “Hello World.” That’s exaggeration but you get the point.
        
        That’s the kind of solution we are building to make video games—> to see where iteration and output takes it.
        
        Let’s say, a VC gives me two options—> 
        
        Option 1. Startup with USD 1 million in my proposal of AI Native Game Engine Venture
        
        Vs
        
        Option 2. Startup with USD 10 million in their idea of an applied AI SAAS Venture
        
        ### I’ll gladly choose ‘Option 1’ on any given day or night.
        
        - Additional Context
            
            Mind you, not looking to raise from one solo investor, could be 2 to 3—> in fact, thats preferred. Happy to talk to institutional investors as well, but it’s preferable if you are actively investing in tech or have previously invested in a known tech startup at any stage. 
            
        
    9. “What device do you currently use, and how have you secured it?”
        
        —> Currently, I do everything from an iPad 7 with a Logitech Keyboard connected via Bluetooth. Both were bought in 2020 during the pandemic to write and do usual digital tasks from anywhere. Have done nothing special to secure it other than using a VPN as general protection from common dangers on the internet/ Wi-Fi. There’s nothing special on it in terms of data, and would be absolute idioticness of anyone trying to waste their, and my time trying to hack it or steal stuff from it. Even though idiots everywhere are convinced about their wises. Whatever, knock yourself out. It’s easily hackable via Logitech Bluetooth, but I don’t have the money to buy apple keypad. Don’t know if it’s worth the use case either.
        
    10. “Hypothetically, are you interested in any government job, for any government in the world?” 
        
        —> I am definitely only interested in full time building this AI native game engine and writing the book. Like, what are we talking about? Happy to help governments as a consultant, but that’s pretty much it.
        
    11. “Why do you want to build the SOLO head band prototype before anything else?”
        
        —> While ANNA, AI native game engine will be our primary development tool, SOLO head band is the longterm consumer product vision. We want to evolve in that direction, rather than pivoting in the future. As a hardware tool, it’ll also be useful during internal development, keeping all data private, and senses focused + streamlined. I’ll be the solo user of the prototype head band under strict terms for both private and official work.
        
    
    1. “AI startups are raising multi million dollars even at pre seed stage. What will you achieve by raising 1 million USD?“
        
        —> We are building an AI Native Game Engine, and not focused or dependent on scaling the compute power, while most of the startups in this space raising massive rounds are reselling compute itself by repackaging/ rewrapping 3rd party LLM’s. Those building foundational models are focused on scaling for results, which requires them to raise massive amounts. 
        
        [https://x.com/business/status/1811326955888771313](https://x.com/business/status/1811326955888771313)
        
        Path Integral would be a research led applied AI outfit, small in size, big in ambition. If we require more compute than we can afford, then we can always raise another round based on execution + performance or collaborate with any company already equipped with massive compute, like ‘xAI’ 🙄.
        
    2. “Read this tweet and provide an answer “
    
    [https://x.com/alexisohanian/status/1811090499068952744](https://x.com/alexisohanian/status/1811090499068952744)
    
    “—> Alexis is right, and his thoughts serve as useful guidance. At first we’ll be building an AI native game engine, and plan to license it to developers. Being lead by research, and to have it as a core foundation of our product, so as to continuously improving, rather than engaging in corrosive or anti social competitive practices is the aim. While purpose of the research remains robust application, and improving the product for the clients.
    
    1. “Are you interested in taking any kind of venture debt?”
        
        —> NO. 
        
    2. “Aren’t you too old to do this?”
        
        —> No. Is this a 100 meter race in the Olympics? Neither am I running for public office to soothe my ego with outdated ideology or useless ideas. Age is not a factor, I am only getting started.
        
    3. “Hypothetically, If you raise $1 million at pre seed stage for let’s say 10% equity, your startup will have a valuation of $10 Million without even having a product. Some people are bonkers bothered about such things.” 
        
        —> Thinking about valuations at pre seed stage is idiotic. The funds are not being raised for valuation, but to get started. Of course, its understandable that such valuation is completely theoretical, rather than being recognised by the markets of any actual value. As a founder, it’s the promise of the said product, the investors are putting the money towards—> for x10 or x100 or even more returns. If you don’t have an appetite for risk or you are devoid of curiosity, then invest your money into something else like real estate or just get into lending business, at the risk of being irrelevant. Plenty of people have lost their money in real estate as well, FYI.
        
        Tech venture capital is a risky game, because in addition to the returns it’s also about curiosity—> not for everyone. Especially to invest in AI, emerging tech or contrarian bets is even riskier than a proven SAAS market which is only dependent on market capture with slight “innovations” and a clear track to accusation or IPO.
        
        But, guess what?—> almost every product category gets disrupted by some emerging tech and better products by making riskier bets at early stage. While those looking for risk free returns laugh on such takes, and later suffer from FOMO. IYKYK.
        
        Many investors are not even positioned to take such risks. So, the best they can do is to shut up or step aside rather than spreading pessimism by being naysayers. 
        
        A founder being transparent, cognisant of all scenarios, flexible in their approach, and being able to take tough decisions is what investors can expect at best.
        
        An investor realising their best chance at making that unprecedented return and filling the void of curiosity is only possible by enabling the founders to take their best shot at the problem on hand. Not everyone is capable of making a dent in the universe. Are you?

    —> “Why are you working on current projects?” 
    
    To build things that can provide logical and artistic value by default rather than being driven primarily by traction—> ‘primarily’ is an imp word because everything needs traction. Subjectively, these products make lives better, that’s intentional to serve objectivity, not for the sake of being noble or kind but for being more functional than promotional because traction is difficult. Not a dis on any person, product or company because they are doing something I should learn. The world is big with space and requirement for everything. 🕊️
    
    —> “What kind of investors/ business partners/ colleagues are you looking for? While we understand any exact specification is useless though a general guideline for any project.” 
    
    Healthy, clear and independent thinking without being distorted by the noise of the past, present and future + to know the difference between Technology—> Product—> Advertising—> Marketing—> Sales is vital along with being aware to not confuse those for subjective benefit or greed in the most mundane sense. Don’t be attached to your biases even if not able to self correct.
    
    Each person has their own subjective view of reality but working on a common goal means constructing a persistent + objective view of reality while bringing awareness and insights from our subjectivity to keep updating this common page using optimal communication—> forming an understanding that prevents rest of the team from drifting away from the page realising eventually our customers/ audience will be sharing our dreams.
    
    Lightness in attitude and wanting to get things done with openness but realising the importance of being based in first principles and having a genuine interest in discovery. While it is absolutely alright to not know, no one knows everything but having a mindset + developing abilities to unlearn and learn within the limits is important for expanding the horizon. You should be able to call spade, a spade—> emotional intelligence ♠️👀
    
    - Additional context
        
        Honesty is the only route to emotional intelligence, the first person you have to be honest with is yourself.
        
        Everything else is emotional manipulation, the first person you manipulate is yourself.
        
    
    —> “Do you want to be a trillionaire?” 
    
    No one is becoming that! Only a small part of the machinery once we get started. Frugal and minimalist with a lifestyle of abundant choices rather than irrational compulsion which includes spending but not over spending 😌
    
    —> “Why don’t you socialise more as that will help find investment leads?” 
    
    I love meeting people, new, even strangers and not necessarily like minded either because listening + consideration of different perspectives is important for a healthy mind. Though, it does not mean I would do business with everyone or anyone especially on passion based ventures because if our values don’t align then the journey won’t align, therefore the outcomes won’t deliver. 
    
    When it comes to active projects, I only like to talk as means of functional progress—> rather than spending endless energy in making impressions or finding equilibrium in wayward + mostly unnecessary power equations—> that’s not my primary role as an artist. We are making dreams here man and I am extremely easy to find 🍺
    
    —> “Are you looking for shortcuts to get rich quick?” 
    
    Super duper quick. What is your concern? That’s verbiage of those envious of other people’s progress. Financial security is a foundation to do great work and not “being Rich,” only an entitled person would confuse earlier with the later. Mostly, this type of thinking is result of an institutionalised mindset which considers progress and growth as privileges reserved for a few. But like one of my friend says—>

    —> “What is the role of a Founder in a startup?”
    
    Founder’s ideas are not supreme and at the same time are no one’s ideas. If you have a better idea that should be adopted than prove it—> imagination, logic, diverse perspectives with nuance, long term value, embracing contradictions of experience; think in those terms rather than “power, expertisome, greed, fame and glory.” No one thinks of Edison or Tesla every time lighting the electric bulb—> take it easy, keep is real 💫
    
    —> “If you are so smart then why not make it all yourself?” 
    
    If not being stupid is smart; trying to sound humble. Have you tried humour? Find me a person who’s completely flawless and “content.” Every life has its own path. By the way, anyone who wants to have a coding competition—> give me a heads up as i need to tune my senses and we can go. Most probably I will lose but let’s learn! Being proud for what you do but don’t understand when people tie their identity to acquired skills- yes, any skill can be acquired and if you focus on it with a purpose, excellence or failure can be found because absurdity of life. Everyone is more than what they do! Nothing worthwhile can be made alone 🤝
    
    —> “What are your thoughts about compliments and praise?” 
    
    *Expect meaning from google—> regard (someone) as likely to do or be something.*
    
    We need to understand the difference between compliment and praise. 
    
    *Compliment from google—> a [polite](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=592174923&hl=en-gb&sxsrf=AM9HkKn6G4XzkVq_Ylng7VEMMmFJy5lUXQ:1702987817205&q=polite&si=ALGXSlaWqc4XvKuO31AnQ7gAsIq_7uvdvwepGOgdCrtbTq_VjGfRPWj9mXYLm6QX0fl0pd4kseh8Jh2YVBKEziJ-vH1ekXP_aQ%3D%3D&expnd=1) expression of praise or [admiration](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=592174923&hl=en-gb&sxsrf=AM9HkKn6G4XzkVq_Ylng7VEMMmFJy5lUXQ:1702987817205&q=admiration&si=ALGXSlbnOEZPfHsS2MaPJwdaOxE_kVevfGsUrFKJ2za_9vp7XUm_uMW61YxPTLRJlpMIJ4Phr6sDgWTtgONXX7oz_bkuUJFm54nYEsG2IJ4goWjKAInjneM%3D&expnd=1). For me, this is in the instant. Complimenting when someone is wearing a nice tie.*
    
    *Praise from google—> express warm approval or [admiration](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=592174923&hl=en-gb&sxsrf=AM9HkKki0JGf1wKEel-upq184FsrzpCVyQ:1702987809999&q=admiration&si=ALGXSlbnOEZPfHsS2MaPJwdaOxE_kVevfGsUrFKJ2za_9vp7XUm_uMW61YxPTLRJlpMIJ4Phr6sDgWTtgONXX7oz_bkuUJFm54nYEsG2IJ4goWjKAInjneM%3D&expnd=1) of. For me, this is after well thought out like praising someone for having a great choice in ties.*
    
    Also, all this is how i personally conduct and not how I ‘expect’ others to conduct.
    
    I compliment people ALL the time, that is honest in the moment admiration which leads to positive interactions.
    
    “Your suit or dress or saree is looking great”
    
    “You are doing good work” —> but this does not cancels if the same person has done or is doing something wrong. 
    
    “You are taking steps in the right direction” —> but i can’t predict the steps they are going to take in the future or even in the next moment. I sure do hope and will praise again at the right time.
    
    “That looks like a good strategy” —> but we will know if this strategy works or not. Therefore, praising someone for having a good strategy does not mean you are praising them for the result. It’s like predicting what shape a cloud would take in 40 hours because right now it looks like a Kangaroo—> i don’t know!
    
    “This dish tastes really good” —> admiration but it’s not a compliment for a dish the same chef is going to make in the future. 
    
    “You are an amazing chef” —> it’s praise but not complimenting the dish they are preparing without tasting it though I am expecting the dish to be great. 
    
    If an architect designed The Empire State Building, it does not mean everything they are doing to design is going to be just as good by default.
    
    I realise there are people who are constantly expecting to hear over the top praises like “you are the greatest” “you are doing everything right” “you can’t take a wrong step” or even “you are god like” —> I just can’t do that in good conscience. 
    
    This does not apply to any kind of sports or performance arts because naturally you are praising something that has already happened, but unlike a ‘performative field’ which needs to be constantly applied and still results can only be assessed in the long term. But a performance lives forever. 
    
    For example—> A great movie is always great even if exactly the same bunch of people make a subsequent “bad” movie. 
    
    A great song is always great even if the same performer has a “bad” song. 
    
    A great product is always great even if the same team subsequently makes a “bad” product. 
    
    Future performance does not invalidate past performances in sports or performance arts or chefs or many fields, but it does not apply to every field. 
    
    Performative fields like politics are more challenging in that sense and not complimenting a politician is not personal. That’s why politicians need to have thicker skin than artists. 
    
    It’s like you laughed at a joke and meet the same person again a day after but not laughing anymore but this offends this person. Does that make sense? Like, take it easy.
    
    Praise is always for the stuff someone has done in the past, even for something they are doing currently—> praise is past tense only, there cannot be praise for future work. It’s not my personal rule, that’s how nature works! 
    
    Hence, if i have already praised someone for their past work, what is the point of me praising them for the same work again and again, everyday? Someone might need to promote their own work on a daily basis but thats their job, it’s not my job or duty to promote or praise anyone everyday—> i don’t even want any job where i would need to praise someone everyday, multiple times a day ‘out of obligation’ rather than thinking about something useful or implementing—> This should not be confused with talking or discussing which has nothing to do with selective praising or complementing or criticising.
    
    If someone is more worried about not being constantly praised rather than focusing on their job then that should be a sure cause for concern for themselves.
    
    When I compliment my future wife that she’s the most beautiful women in the world is a personal compliment from myself to her, its between us. If some other person does not share that same sentiment, both of us are not going to fight with them because that would be crazy and a total waste of our time. Try to apply this example to other situations especially in business or politics.
    
    Again, being nuanced helps—> praising someone’s career even in politics or business is something I do. It’s obviously past tense, for decisions they have already made and there’s enough proper data to analyse the performance. 
    
    Not same as someone still in their job because I don’t want to make them complacent either or in case of public interaction, don’t want to give an impression that this person can’t do anything wrong because anyone can make mistakes and are capable of doing wrong.
    
    Not trying to be above anyone though, i just don’t EXPECT over the top praise or compliments from anyone. It fine when someone compliments and sure feels good for a moment but I like to quickly remind myself about it being past tense, to not get complacent in the present.
    
    There’s a vibe and understanding when talking to friends or family, you know this compliment or praise is only in the moment or we are kidding around if something feels over the top.

    —> “Why did you not take covid vaccine?”
    
    I have complete trust in the medical researchers and scientists who did great work in a short time to save many venerable lives across India and the world. The whole production line needs to be complimented for their effort. At the same time, such were the circumstances, they did not get proper time to follow the procedures as they would for any other drug but thats just my own fastidiousness.
    
    I already had covid at least once, so, that’s one more reason, I did not feel the need to take the vaccine. 
    
    I am super extra cautious than most people, so, that’s one more reason, because I would have still taken same precautions even after taking the vaccine.
    
    Anna did not take the vaccine, so, that’s another small reason I did not take it. Can’t let her face any danger alone and I don’t care what anyone else thinks about that. This was NOT a primary reason, but a small motivator.
    
    —> “This is a lot of theory, are you Wikipedia? In fact, we will classify everything you have done as theory because you have not made money. Take practical action.” 
    
    What are you even talking about?! If your hustle works it’s an inspiring story and it’s a joke when it doesn’t, but at least laughter is good for health. You need a script to make a movie, you need a plan to build a business and you need research if making a new product in varying degrees of forms and factors. I have been doing the required, necessary and voluntary for a long time.
    
    Learned it the hard way, but if we are in a collaboration and I am not being paid or its not a fair or tact arrangement, i do my part, don’t do work of the other side or for them, till that is sorted—> this way remaining time and energy can be put into more promising projects. Along with various other factors to keep my mind and mojo healthy. It’s a levels thing, if you don’t get it, you won’t. 
    
    Current situation—> It is what it is. The necessary and required is being done. 🤯
    
    —> “What are your views about the elderly?”
    
    Hypothetically, If whole of my time spent with other people is equal to 100 than I have spent 65 of that with the elderly. 
    
    Experience is not wisdom, but is definitely useful data which can be a good guide when analysed with proper filters.
    
    I like older people, can even manage them, but I don’t want to, like I don’t want to manage anyone because have realised the greatest gift we can give anyone is honesty and freedom to pursue their own expectations. Even the elders. Age is only a number. We all will be old, it’s the cycle of life 🤷🏾‍♂️ and managing builds insecurity while managed support builds trust.
    
    As I am getting older and have already spent a lot of time with the elders, it sought of emerged as a pattern where I would find myself more comfortable with the elderly, therefore, trying to break the pattern in the last few years by trying to interact more with the youth. 
    
    Young people need to balance exuberance in communication and focus more of it on the task. Nobody asked for this, but it’s my two cents/paisa/penny/bits.
    
    —> “How much has been your earnings in financial year 2022-23, 23-24, 24-25?” 
    
    My total combined earnings from all sources of revenue for financial years mentioned above were less than INR 250,000/- that is why I have not filled income tax this financial year, because income tax filing is not mandatory below that amount. Yeah, it’s been a bad few year financially. Though, i have paid indirect taxes relative to all spendings. Like, when travelling on the metro I pay for the ticket + GST, therefore, use of the escalator or walking on the fine marble is justified.
    
    —> “What is the difference between being interdependent and being dependent?” 
    
    Everything in nature that includes us human beings is interdependent on each other, which is beautiful and also reflects in everyday life around the planet to the whole of solar system and the universe. On the other hand being dependent means not being responsible for your own self and actions—> you are outsourcing that responsibility to someone else which is not great. Just talking about myself, as much as possible I try not to depend on others while being interdependent is natural.
    
    - Additional Query
        
        —> “Are you not interested in contributing to your community, especially local community?” 
        
        I don’t litter at all, have not created any menacing situation and neither been part of any unlawful situation where the state would have to spend precious resources. If someone comes to me for help and I am in a position to help, all things considered, however small, I do help without advertising—> those are contributions. 
        
        I am working on projects that when successful—> I will be in a position to take practical initiatives to contribute to the community where i grew up, communities where i have worked and to the people around the world rather than only making appearances for the sake of public relations—> this is not written as general criticism of anyone else. 
        
        There’s already plan with ‘Dharma Initiative’ to extend + augment abilities and serve humanity as best as we can by making practical contribution. But we need to get there and life’s journey is never linear.
        
        Immediacy of irrational thinking can make belief that all contributions are needed to be made right now—> then call every person of Indian origin back to India? Cancel all foreign trips and travel. No, right? That would not make any sense. Much of this type of thinking or actions are known as bullying and everyone can become a noble citizen by trying to show sensibility + empathy towards your local and non local environment.
        
    
    —> “You seem opinionated on certain issues or use criticism to say negative things on those topics?” 
    
    “Opinionated” would be when I am not ready to listen…well, I let people speak and like listening to everyone. It’s not “criticism” or “negative comments” for the sake of it, but calling spade, a spade or sometimes reserving my comments to not indulge because I don’t need to voice my opinion unnecessarily as everything is not made or said for me, but if someone has a problem even with that then its their problem—> correcting them is setting the record straight and not negativity. 
    
    One of the important things I learned from a lady known as Gillian Gordon, Course Director at MA for Producing is a core rule of criticism—> “first say something positive, anything and then give your honest views about the subject at hand.” It is a mix of that and creative thinking + scientific reasoning—> to give constructive feedback is to help people + the cause and not for anything else. 
    
    Also, where should I draw the line on fake compliments if I don’t like a feature in a product or a movie or anything that we use? I analyse between its subjectiveness to myself or being an inherent issue with the product and based on that assessment, feedback is built, then shared. 
    
    For example—> If I’ve said something is not working with twitter at any point, its not because I want to say anything negative about Elon, why the fuck would i waste my time saying anything about him unless I have something to share, like a thought or an idea? I just want the problem fixed or a feature added or to help twitter or i might be talking about a related subject matter. Also, giving feedback about one product does not apply to every other product or every other company he owns. It’s objective feedback shared about a particular issue.
    
    Another example—> if I’ve mentioned “Read Subjectively” its because I don’t want to influence other people on that subject and let them analyse it for themselves. It does not mean I have a negative opinion. Personally, I have no ideology other than the human spirit which is shared with everyone regardless of anything else.
    
    There are number of different personal analytic tools I use to stay objective rather than just saying random things—> other than when its humour 🤣
    
    —> “Reasons for past failures and lessons learned?” 
    
    Many perspectives but no point diving into water under the bridge. Call them mistakes or choices or life…trying to work with same values, ambition and passion but differently. I always admit my mistakes but that does not discount other people’s mistakes, call it luck or something else…details are important—> but everyone is forgiven, all they need to do is forgive themselves and not repeat the mistakes if they can’t correct them. Every second is a lesson, every space is an opportunity and every passing moment is a call to action 🚀
    
    —“Have you ever taken unauthorised substances of any kind at all?” 
    
    No, never felt the need. Naturally cool and weird.
    
    Haven’t taken any body building supplements either—> this is not a negative endorsement…i don’t care what you do with your own body🏋️
    
    —> “We are concerned about your personal life choices.” 
    
    I take complete responsibility for my personal life as conscious decisions that should not directly effect the business and any sensible investor/ business partner would understand unless your philosophy is to control rather than trust or make your opinion based on gossip and rumours < always available for a conversation to address concerns 📢
    
    - Additional Context
        
        If you don’t believe in a fulfilling personal life than i doubt the quality and wholesomeness of that you are building. Protecting each other’s freedom is naturally promoting each other’s responsibility.
        
        —> do you have any inkling what it takes to think deeply, to dive into the void of actual research when working on AI or any kind of actual science, art or engineering? My life is organised around refining my wisdom through knowledge rather than how that looks to you, a third person with no perspective or insight into my way of thinking—> so wtf are you judging?! If you a person who confuses the “usual” with the natural then that is your problem sir or madam. 
        
        —> My personal and public life are separate from my work/ research which is a dimension on its own—> I am completely aware of how to keep them separated, that’s how it’s best lived and should not be fiddled around with by layman.
        
        —> Think about your work as a warehouse or a diamond mine or a painting or mathematics board or a blank paper or rocket manufacturing workshop or a restaurant or programming or coding or travelling salesman or sports team or a teacher or a stock market or hospital or a journalist or a social media platform or a construction company or a general store or a luxury brand store or a security guard or a house maid or career politician or a government official or a small business or a unicorn! 
        
        I wanted to be more specific to drive the point home but for now will just get to the point—> thinking time varies from implementation time in each of those cases, its not the same across the board. 
        
        You need to be equipped to implement well of course but what people don’t realise is that you also need to be equipped to ‘think well—> actionable thinking’ which automatically + efficiently reduces the implementation time. In btw is also ‘communicating well’ but we will discuss that some other day. 
        
        Hard work is when you don’t love what you do and know the outcome like a salary at the end of the month but still have to do it. Which is fine because it works for most people. It’s a good system but it does not work for everyone and clever work slides in between for those more aspirational.
        
        Let’s be honest, most people don’t even know what they would love to do and that is also fine because society is globally well equipped and structured in different degrees to make it fun for everyone outside the jobs.
        
        Fortunately, i have had experience with all varieties of this, therefore—> doing that you love is a blessing. ‘Actionable thinking’ is a huge part of it which feeds directly into implementing well and is a 24x7 job.
        
    
    —> “Your use of social media seems really distracting from work.” 
    
    Firstly, if your assessment of any project or myself is based on my social media activity rather than direct engagement/ conversation then that’s your fault. Only social media I use frequently is Twitter/X or Instagram for information and education + it all feeds into the current primary task of looking for resources to be able to actually focus on objective work. If you look at it as “addiction” it’s purpose based controlled action and fortunately good at noise cancellation. 🎧

    —> “What’s your criteria of sharing issues based content in any capacity on social media?” 
    
    To be bluntly honest, I don’t form an opinion on anything until consideration of all the facets of any given subject, especially, any topics dealing with social issues rather than personal issues. Because, if a problem is personal then it’s more specific and easier to address—> that also has to do with how the issue is presented.
    
    For examples—> if people from 10 different religion or any region simply share that they have planted a tree, i will share all 10 tweets. So on…
    
    If the person posting some content is genuinely trying to shine a light on a given subject from all facets as a means of seeking solution or they are trying to form an opinion based on a particular perspective to start a debate—> that is not to ascertain the good or bad of their opinion, but the details of the matter. All issues can not lead to instant solutions, therefore, informed debate is important, but debates themselves are not medium of information—> they are to help form an opinion based on the insights of the debaters from the information already available to the users/ readers/ audience/ participants.
    
    It’s not “people pleasing” when I don’t want to unfairly upset anyone to realise that an important piece of information was left unconsidered. For example—> human rights, women rights and freedom, animal rights, environment conservation are issues that require unconditional consideration and support without any kind of bias. Though, it’s not necessary that all content made around these issues is non biased, especially when also dealing with sensitive topics like politics and identity. Therefore, i try not to share any such content without consumption because I have done that in the past and it was not fair on many grounds. If specific content mentions a friend or acquaintance in some capacity then ideally I like addressing it personally and directly with them before sharing, even at the cost of my own benefit. Symbolism is not a consideration.
    
    Humour is humour—> no rules apply there unless if the joke can draw attention of irrationality. It’s a joke made to be laughed at, maybe some self reflection, any other analysis of humour is irrational.
    
    > Consider this by Ricky Gervais—> Please stop saying "You can't joke about anything anymore". You can. You can joke about whatever the fuck you like. And some people won't like it and they will tell you they don't like it. And then it's up to you whether you give a fuck or not. And so on. It's a good system.
    > 
    
    As long as they tell you “they don’t like it” with civility of a joke itself. Golden rule applies here as well.

    —> “What do you have to say to those who are threatened by more technology?”
    
    Usually, this mindset is a mark of people used to and relying on pre defined processes built by ancestors without truly understanding anything. They are filled with pompous ego and envy believing manipulation to be virtuous while relying on the very technology that they belittle for every aspect of their life.
    
    The whole reason our ancestors made these processes is because they knew that future generations will be filled with fools, but probably they underestimated the foolishness. There is nothing like “less” or “more” technology—> would it make sense for a horse to pull an electric car? Or to drive on rocky terrains rather than on smooth roads? Would you have airplanes that can only take off but not land? Or piece of land which can grow crops only once and you have to look for new land every season? No. I can do this whole day but have better things to think about unlike the pessimists.
    
    No one is forcing anyone to use technology, people can chose how much tech they use based on their requirements in daily life or desire to stay up to date which has nothing to do with development of technology or its use by others.
    
    Wanting to use mobile phones for everything you like but lamenting about use cases that others use it for is known as hypocrisy. There is a wide spectrum of use cases for everything and relative filters which also keep improving. It’s important to understand that all technology improves over time and it’s not perfect right away—> the microwave was not invented at the same time our ancestors discovered fire for cooking food! Here’s a fax machine that can solve all of your problems, we should have just stopped there itself 📠 
    
    —> “Do you think of yourself as a genius?” 
    
    No. Don’t think there are any and that would be the end of me or anyone thinking of themselves as such. Limited to my interests as stated [here](Ventures%E2%80%94%20AI%20Native%20Game%20Engine%20692cd876d32e4108bc0839b384ecd66e.md) but trying with all objective attention which is still not good enough 🤷‍♂️ and that is why need a team and money! 🧐
    
    —> “What are your views on healing?” 
    
    We are always continuously healing and at the same time need to understand that our experiences could have been widely different. Compassion is probably the more important aspect that allows us to respect all our differences while still optimistically functioning for our own selves but also for mankind’s future.❣️
    
    —> “Are you against Fin Tech or Banks?” 
    
    Not at all. Giving feedback that can improve my experience as a customer is not “disliking” or a “revolt.” I like things inc my experiences being simple, fair but optimally useful and all thoughts are shared from that perspective📱
    
    —> “We are offended by something you had said” 
    
    Always happy and prefer to have a civil and direct discourse without prejudice to work out our differences rather than any indirect **manoeuvring**. If anyone has tried or been trying indirect manoeuvres than they still have the option at any time for a without prejudice direct conversation. If at fault than happy to accept my mistake🍻
    
    —> “We are really concerned about your ‘line of sight’ just because we need something to be concerned about” 
    
    During orientation of my first job I told the brain trust that “I stare” which is part of being an artist but with time have learned to register everything that is in my field of vision without always directly staring. If you are in my FOV, moving, static or levitating—> I notice. If you are self conscious, well don’t be, also it might be your own issue or thinking upon bias of information 🤷‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️
    
    —> “what are your thoughts about loyalty?” 
    
    It is a shared responsibility and best judged by the virtue of being kind rather than only by the transaction of “niceties” ✌️
    
    —> “Do you own any crypto currency or what is your history with Crypto?”
    
    The only time I ever bought any crypto was Bitcoin in December of 2021 for INR 5000. Though, i did come across the Bitcoin white paper in 2010 while looking for privacy solutions to protect my work and also self volunteered to “solve” Facebook revenue problems on my own by restructuring its revenue model based on blockchain like mechanism. But I did not think of Crypto from the perspective of making an app or trading, being an astute observer, trying to stay out of all trouble at that time and till quite recently. 
    
    I used technical topic or subjects to write about in fictional screenplays, though, did get interested in exploring the business side of blockchain after spotting underlining potential because of the research for the screenplay. Tried putting together a project in 2017 between a company called Amtrak India that only does projects in collaboration or initiated by Government of India/ Federal Branches and a company based in Powai, Mumbai already developing blockchain project as a Government of India funded pilot. Though nothing concrete happened there and I moved on due to differences with Amtrak India.
    
    My interest in the business side of blockchain and crypto reignited in mid to late 2021 as Cinemas were non operational and other several unnecessary roadblocks made it difficult to make any progress in that domain. After an year of research for practical implementation as a start up product which continued till mid to late 2022 and led to some key insights, had to take a step back as the crypto industry imploded and by then I had found more familiar interest in AI. 
    
    That’s pretty much it. 
    
    —> “What are your political views?” 
    
    Not affiliated with any political party and want to stay away from the practice of everyday politics. Political science as a subject or history lessons are interesting and essential to understanding the workings of our nation and the world. 
    
    Giving constructive feedback to our government is not political though I try not to have any “coffee table conversations” re politics unless to add nuance in conversations.
    
    Those in politics will always see everything as political as that is one of the function of their job even though not the primary job description, more power to them for knowing their responsibilities and doing their actual jobs. 
    
    Politics as a job is also image driven which is again fine for those who have to do that within reason. It makes no sense to connect anything I do, say, write with any kind of political manoeuvring or any political person or political party in particular unless stated specifically.
    
    I do believe in the importance of having multiple political parties as part of a robust democratic system. Evolving Capitalism is the only true solution for this amazing human civilisation composed of forever everlasting great nations as recognised by the United Nations. Communism and socialism are bullshit. 
    
    I am always interested in the progress of India/ Bharat 🇮🇳 and the human civilisation but don’t think indulging in everyday politics is necessary to contribute. 
    
    I am interested in Global and ever lasting peace on planet earth, but have absolutely NO self interest in any Geo political issues whatsoever. 
    
    Politics working as a hurdle for specific interests rather than an enabler will be challenged in courts and public forums as per the constitution to set things right. Jai Hind.
    
    Absolutely no one is authorised to personally represent me inside any political party or take part in any political discourse on my behalf. That does not mean I personally can’t be friends, associate or acquaintance with a member of any political party. Please consider kindness and peace before politics 🤍
    
    —> “How come you never voted in the general elections of India/ Bharat?”
    
    Voting is our primary right in a democracy and should be exercised with ease, period. 
    
    I got my first job away from home in Mumbai just when I was turning 20 y.o in 2007 and was in London during the first eligible elections to be able to vote in 2009. Then in 2014, i did want to vote but my name was not in the electoral list apparently. Mom and Dad were delivered their voter ID card at home and I don’t recall if my brother got his card then but he definitely did not vote.
    
    I did try to enquire through did not go out of my way either as was not getting any satisfactory answer to begin with. I could not understand if I have a passport, a PAN Card at that time than why did my name was not in the electoral list?
    
    Later, there was a way to register online to receive your voter ID card, I did register more than once using that link from the best of my memory though still no voter ID card was ever delivered. There was a lot of talk in the political circles on TV News about Aadhar card not being useful so i took my time but when it was clear that it is useful, safe and mandatory, i got the Aadhar made but even after that my name was not in the electoral list and I did not receive a voter’s ID card in 2019. At that time, i was again travelling within India and there was no provision to vote remotely. 
    
    I don’t understand why it’s such a puzzle to be able to vote?! If one has a passport, a PAN Card, Aadhar card then why a voter’s ID is not automatic? I do understand that remote voting is not an easy process and could be really expensive to implement in a country of more than billion people but hopefully the whole process of voting could be made easier to exercise and transparent to take our great democracy to even greater heights.
    
    If i had a chance to vote at those times then I would have voted based on the prime ministerial candidates which is a mistake on my part based on the established system of our democracy but the local candidates usually don’t have any practical plan to improve local facilities. These local candidates have further community representatives, most of whom i know are drunk alcoholics working more as mediators using different kind of force and farce rather than any actual skills to make people’s lives better. There is no immediate accountability for these local self professed netas and god knows what happens to every 1 rupee when its starts its journey from the RBI to the people of India. Of course, now we know electoral bonds was a scam in the name of political donations.
    
    Jai Hind. Bharat Mata Ki Jai! 🇮🇳
    
    As an educated person even, though I am 12th fail 😅, I don’t want to vote rhetoric of a local representative but actual program and the process they are going to follow to make it happen without corruption. This should benefit local development from the farmer to the last person without bias. Slogans mean nothing to me and come across as shallow rubbish used to manipulate people.
    
    Sometimes you have to pick a leader due to lack of good choices. One can’t say who they are going to vote for in the coming elections but in the previous elections where i was eligible to vote being citizen of the great democratic Republic of India, this is who I would have voted for progress and development of democratic systems + the economy of India/ Bharat being the only factors—>
    
    2009–> Dr. Manmohan Singh
    
    2014—> Shri Narendra Modi
    
    2019—> Shri Narendra Modi
    
    In 2004 when I was not eligible, I would have voted for Late Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee
    
    I still don’t have a voter ID card by the way, as my name is never in the local electoral lists.
    
    —> “What about other world democracies?”
    
    I do follow world affairs, to have a fresh mental model of our global civilisation. It’s useful in writing stories, making films, technology is a global phenomenon. I have been studying financial markets as well, though not trading, but it’s about keeping your hand on the pulse of the global trade when you do dive in with enough money, rather than starting uninformed.
    
    Like everyone else, I do casually follow 🇺🇸 American Politics. Obviously, can’t vote but have been an admirer of President Abraham Lincoln, President Barrack Obama, Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
    
    I was rooting for President Joe Biden in 2020 elections which was more than wanting to see Mr. Donald Trump out of the Oval Office. I read a detailed story somewhere about the Biden family trying to save one of their sons suffering from a fatal health condition and felt attachment based on compassion. Joe seemed genuinely a good person and someone worth having the responsibility of becoming president of USA. In fact, i was hoping for him to run for the Oval office in 2016 as well.good. 
    
    Aunt Kamala has secured the spot to run for the White House against Mr. Trump. Being American means to be a free thinker, first and foremost. To carry the spirit of cultures from across the world to enhance the American spirit. To not hold back your steps in fear of some vague dogmas. I’ve been following aunt Kamala’s career since her time as a prosecutor in California. It’s true, sometimes she does come across as uninformed or opinionated, but she’s always eager to learn and improve her understanding to make better decisions. This is an important quality that any head of state shall poses—> accountability + responsibility. Her journey from an aspirational candidate to becoming leader of the free world is a coming of age story that’ll inspire girls + boys everywhere in the world regardless of race, religion or nationalities. I am looking forward to seeing her as the next president of USA. 
    
    Addition of Coach Walz strengthens the team in a strong place. I never heard about Tim before, but he seems like a role model with his career in the armed forces, other than being a governor, coach and a teacher. He brings that cool coach energy that is not only great for the campaign, but would also be useful in the White House and international diplomacy. 
    
    More so, Prosecutor Harris and Coach Walz, complement each other really well to deliver. I am looking forward to them upholding American values of learning, upgrading, but sticking to their promises. Future of democracies might depend on doing the right thing. God bless America 🗽 🙏🏽
    
    But Elon Musk supports Mr. Trump, and you seem like a hUge musk admirer. Why this contradiction?
    
    I can’t speak for Elon, of course. However, as much as I know him, the differences with the Democratic Party are due to lack of proper communication or logical reasoning from the democrats, where he felt slighted. It’s just my personal opinion, if the democrats spend more time listening to Elon’s concerns, rather than dictating, then there’s a chance of forming better understanding on key issues. 
    
    Regardless, as individuals we can hold different political opinion, and still be friends. lol. 😅 🤷🏽‍♂️
    
    Since, i used to live in The 🇬🇧 UK and happen to read the news papers, that’s where I found interest in the political sciences. There it’s much more complicated than USA. I think Prime Minister David Cameron was doing a fine job of rebuilding the economy but Brexit was just a disastrous decision even though based on a referendum. 
    
    Miliband brothers interested me for a while but they never seemed to get their act together…..which is a familiar dynamic. I even had some hopes from Boris Johnson but my god 🤦🏾‍♂️
    
    Rishi Sunak was dignified in his term as prime minister, and even when leaving office.
    
    Let’s see how Sir Keir Starmer goes about his term as prime minister.
    
    I was also extremely casually following Russia’s politics but would not like to comment due to the ongoing war which I do NOT support at all. I am only in favour of unconditional peace and dialogue based conflict resolution via diplomacy. I do hope for some near term resolution to restore peace in that region as Language of love > clash of egos. 
    
    Democracies are built in peace, rather than in war, just something to remember for those in support of always evolving rule based democratic order. Peace is vital for progress. 
    
    —> “What are your religious views?” 
    
    Secular and NON religious. I respect all religions based on an individual’s right to practice their belief without imposing it on others in any shape, way or form. I respect all local cultures even when driven by religion and consider culture as an important aspect of keeping the fabric of rational society together. I grew up around Hinduism and am familiar with all its aspects inside out, therefore don’t have to rely on other people’s interpretation. I respect that history and associated institutions.
    
    Don’t like other labels either though believe we are insignificant in the scheme of things and yet the power of love makes us whole. If you like to call the Universe as God, I am a believer in “God is same everywhere” Leo Tolstoy 💛🩷❤️🧡💚🩵💙💜🤎🖤🩶🤍
    
    —> “Tell us one regret that you turned into a lesson and practice.” 
    
    I was trying to make a short animated film in 2009 in open + lose collaboration with an animation company in London. We shot some emails in trying to find funding for the film and got a vague reply from someone at BBC’s Olympics committee. A highly enthusiastic 21 years old—> I started development without any financial commitment by the studio or BBC or anyone, even got a Concept Artists on board who was as enthusiastic as myself—> she left her life in Germany and relocated to London partly based on the belief that we are already working out of an established animation company and will find funding but we did not even after lot of efforts + hustling. It took me a while to realise her predicament but i was already living on scraps so could not compensate for the amazing work. Ever since, have never hired anyone without money in the bank—> based on loose associations or non commitments, there had been other such experiences as well which fortunately only affected myself because of that lesson turned into practice. 💷
    
    —> “What is your sexual orientation?” 
    
    I am heterosexual straight men with an average size working, normally working and active D**K that is only interested in women—> 😘 Anna Chukova 🤗 specifically. Also, I believe in an individual’s right to practice their sexuality without imposing on others in any shape, way or form or being subjected to judgment by others 🧬
    
    —> “Do you consider yourself a scientist or want to become a scientist?” 
    
    Does one needs a label to build something of value? No and… no. Zero % interest in taking the academic route 📑
    
    —> “Are you interested in pursuing any stage of formal education?”
    
    Absolutely Not interested in pursuing formal education anywhere. I already have an MA acquired in 2009 from Royal Holloway, University of London.
    
    —> “How are you vulnerable? Give us an example?”
    
    I am always open for fair and direct negotiations to reach a progressive + rational solution, also known as positive sum games 😎 
    
    - Additional Context
        
        Those are X ray glasses to spot bullshit, can also smell and hear it out. Rationality is not based on what works best for either party but what’s required to get the best out of any situation in the present, for the future.
        
    
    —> “Give us a really brief bio of yourself, really brief.” 
    
    I was born in New Delhi and raised in an industrial town on its outskirts known as Faridabad in the state of Haryana alongside an older brother. An ‘out of time’ place which could have existed anywhere in the world going through interesting cultural evolutions and changes in real time 😁…wide open spaces at that time with a capitalist vibe in its nature—> it was India but kind of global with neighbours from all different Indian subcontinent cultural backgrounds—> even has a golf course! Along with Doordarshan + Bollywood, on the TV, Cinema and Digital side I also grew up with America 😀 though never been there. Moving is in the nature of the being and it’s important to keep your thinking clear + horizons broad—> so I have been wanting to from a young age and particularly fascinated by Bombay—> initially got to be there while working for an amazing company doing Hollywood VFX with greyish but kind people 🤣. It truly became ‘Fictional City of Bombay’ when I met Anna ❤️ Tver, Russia. Also got to experience even broader range of cultures, situations and people while studying + living in and around London like a darker side of greyish 😂 friend and my ex boss who built a thriving construction company there at the age of 64 . Some might look at my experiences as tough, inadequate or bad decisions—> I just find it all tremendously fascinating 🍿 and appreciate everyone even those not mentioned while travelling through my own shades of grey 🙏
    
    - Additional Context
        
        Some people not only have a habit but unnecessary urge to put negativity into everything. If positivity and honesty seems to you like “political correctness” then so be it. I am not personally interested or in the business of unnecessarily debating with anyone. 
        
        —> my life is not for everyone, it’s not recommended unless you want to make your kind of music, unless you want to be out there among the stars, unless you love with an open heart and not afraid to start again with lessons but no regrets. The purpose is discovery, rest is by product but mostly “consequences.”💡
        
    
    —> “What are you scared of in general?“ Nothing expect God/ Universe/ Bhagwaan / all other languages. It has nothing to do with fear but realisation of impermanence. Here are some quotes—>
    
    > “The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.” ~ **Alan Wilson Watts**
    > 
    > 
    > 
    > “The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.” ~ **Rabindranath Tagore**
    > 
    > **“Happiness is impermanent, like everything else…” ~ Thich Nhat Hanh**
    > 
    
    Almost all scholars in religion or other institutions have written about this subject as in the Bhagavad Gita. Quotes that are not mentioned here are not omission, can’t put every quote from everyone here. Read the above again and calm down 🙏
    
    —> “Talk about anger?”
    
    I still have to meet a person who does not get angry and are healthy. Getting angry and expressing it peacefully in the moment or with assertiveness or accepting that you momentarily misjudged the situation is actually better and healthy compared to keeping the anger inside of you to show that you don’t get angry at all but taking it out in manipulative ways later.
    
    No, I do not get angry often—> i won’t get angry if you make a mistake. Primarily, i get angry when people are purposely imposing a scenario or are forcing an issue without listening due to their insecurities which can also be attributed as bullying and my patience for that runs thin if I am hungry or thirsty. Otherwise, i lose patience when the same bullying is repeated—> even then it is addressed on the spot, only through assertive words, always non-violently/ peacefully. I don’t keep agendas against people for 10 years or even beyond 1 day, actually not even beyond that moment unless it’s repeated. Don’t want to keep my energy spent or focused on that as there are so many wonderful things to think about and beauty to be absorbed in the world 🫵🏽
    
    Can you bring up any record of me being non violent? There was an incident when a semi drunk person purposefully non stop shouted and cursed at me starting approx 3am till approx 530am at a hotel while i was only sitting in the cafe, doing work. I did not shout back or curse at him but kept typing, writing, finished the work and sent it. Then, shook hands with him the same morning while having a peaceful conversation about his bad manners. There have been many incidents like these where I have taken the most peaceful route again and again 🤍 
    
    —> “What is your criteria for general purpose collaboration or acquaintance?”
    
    Honesty and transparency. That’s the minimum. I get turned off by dishonest and manipulative people because there is no basic foundation to that kind of collaboration. We might continue to keep in touch sometimes if I see scope of you being honest or in case I am interested in your lies. 
    
    Being honest does not mean “you never lie” but do you have the character to say the truth? That also applies to those trying to give specific advice—> if you don’t even know yourself, what are you doing? You don’t know me. Stop judging like it’s not speculative at all, if you are super confident about your wrong virtues, there’s likely no foundational honesty in or around you.
    
    —> “what do you consider absolute waste of time?” 
    
    People trying to prove their point by enforcing their point when they are actually being ignorant—> hive mind thinking or cynics with “trying to be right at any cost” mentality. It’s not so much any behaviour that’s particularly bothersome but trying to persist or impose to test its outside acceptance or justification—> like “a mission to tune someone” based on your own bias rather than self acceptance + self approval via direct feedback based understanding is unproductive and a waste of resources 🦠
    
    —> “Have you considered being a Stand up comic rather?”
    
    I have in fact thought about that on many occasions in theory but never implemented practically 🤣 🤣🤣
    
    Why does fun needs to be “professional?” Humour is an effect of being good at other things actually. If I can bring joy to anyone in anyway, thats awesome! Though, like with other things, if you want to pay me for being funny, contact directly 😅
    
    —> “But you are “always kidding” and sometimes serious conversations are essential. What if you make an awkward joke in an important meeting?”
    
    Everything written here is minus negative or positive emotions, it’s neutral lightness. Also, I am not into pranks, only regular humour…..you know like sarcasm, irony, poor sounding jokes…that stuff.
    
    I indulge in serious discourse when a serious topic/subject is being discussed with ‘sincerity and honesty’ which has nothing to do with being sad. Lightness and joy are essential for a positive sum mindset which can elevate conversations through unrealised options in every situation rather than being trapped by joylessness, envy and greed.
    
    —> “Do you have a hidden agenda or cause or ideology?”
    
    No. Other than being able to help bring good and prosperity by building products, stories and space ships. I do have perspectives and feedback about general course of things and of course there is self interest as well…🤘
    
    —> “Are you against governments or established structures?”
    
    No. But who is satisfied with their government or any government? You can’t make everyone happy and that is not even the job. Like everything else, even governments, organisational and supporting structures need updates to better serve the people—> so when I give my thoughts to improve these processes they are just that without any right/left or political bias. Yes, some of these opinions could be plain wrong, not thought out enough or without privileged/ classified information—> i admit if that is the case 🏛️
    
    A brief comment about private established structures—>
    
    letting people know about their own ignorance is not being against them but we have tied everything so strictly to branded reward points from generalised public opinion that even directly given informed feedback is taken as attack when someone is only trying to help💰
    
    —> “You have strong views on privacy, why?”
    
    Privacy is important because not everyone is equipped to understand everything we do all the time but that does not stop people from making unnecessary judgments based on their half, biased or sometimes totally wrong POV.
    
    It’s important from a spiritual perspective to spend quality time alone to construct better thoughts. Listening to gibberish has not helped anyone.
    
    It’s creatively rewarding to curate thoughts without outside influence or judgement.
    
    It’s crucial from a business perspective to keep tight hold of your data to prevent competition of any kind from taking advantage of the hard work. Thats’s how I started researching about privacy and security, to find ways to share my ideas and developed work with third parties while protecting financial interests.
    
    No, I do not use VPN to watch porn. I don’t watch porn. Do you understand how the World Wide Web works? If you knew, then you won’t be asking why online and digital privacy is important. There are plenty of information on the web itself to educate yourself on this topic.
    
    I do think law enforcement should have access to public or private data of citizens but through a proper legal process because law enforcement is also made of people like you and me or in some cases working for corrupt politicians or being manipulated by powerful corporates. Just like we need law, we also need to make sure those working to maintain the law are also following the rules and don’t have a free rein on citizen‘s data. There needs to be proper channels to access data rather than loopholes, to downplay misuse by all sides.
    
    —> “What is your problem with taking photographs or videos? What are you hiding from?”
    
    I have no problems in taking candid photographs or videos when I am politely asked first or when I am being compensated/ paid. For the right price, you can make me stand in front of a live camera for hours. 
    
    Photos or videos for self promotion are fine and you can find them on my social media.
    
    Sometimes one has to take these kind of photos to be “nice” and sociable which is not a judgment of anyone else + people should do what they like of course, it’s only a personal thing—> just find it repulsive to show off beyond purpose or being a “fame whore” term coined by Kristen Stewart to describe people who lose their mind over fame 🤮
    
    —> “What are your thoughts about fame?” 
    
    It’s an important part of society’s function and should be used responsibly. There are different types of fames of course—> don’t believe in chasing fame for the sake of it, at the same time not against anyone taking that route. A famous person should be able to contribute, give back in thought or action as per their capacity and at the same time should not be forced either 📺 🤳
    
    —> No action or mistake is fatal unless it has irreversible negative impact on people’s lives and those are rare cases. Even though, open to all probabilities that arise from life, if you have an open mind to transparency then let’s solve some problems together? [Contact](Ventures%E2%80%94%20AI%20Native%20Game%20Engine%20692cd876d32e4108bc0839b384ecd66e.md) —> “Wait! are you trying to sound like a saint or hero?” 
    
    No. To repeat, staying open to peaceful consideration of infinite probabilities in life to make informed choices 🌅 
    
    —> “Are you waiting for a miracle?” 
    
    Is that what we are calling honesty, transparency and —> resources to build these days? Than, yes. By the way, same could be said about the people expecting anything practical + useful without the said “miracle.” 🌤️
    
    —> “Are you going to build based on the open tabs or bookmarks in your browser?”
    
    I read a lot of stuff available openly to build knowledge but have an actual product theory unlike some perverts looking for shortcuts by sneak peaking into unpublished work. Being ethical and having a positive sum mindset is important for doing useful science + creativity + capitalism rather than looking to get ahead for the sake of taking credit.
    
    —> “You haven’t ever done any real world work, you know?”
    
    Among other things listed here, my side job for 8 years was in the construction industry. Sure, I was not actually laying bricks, still it was work enabling real construction and more—> pretty real. Lots of paper work, dealing with extremely diverse set of people and their grievances to get them to pay without hassle while “my boss” was trying to sue anyone in sight, therefore, a lot of legal work as well 😅. 
    
    Also, movies are something people watch in the real world and not in dreams, every stage of the process to make them is quite real. Even the projects in different domains that in the end did not work out involved dealing with real people and then deciding to not deal with them 😂 were also real decisions. 
    
    Let me tell you something, even to sit and hear people talk but to decipher the bullshit for reality and building fictional ideas or tech applications out of client speak is much more than real in terms of doing extremely hard work. Not for everyone used to following regular pre defined processes. Think about it 🤠
    
    All you need to do is read the track record essays.
    
    —> “What is your problem with non-direct communication?
    
    We all do it because we love a mess and making everything more difficult + complicated than it’s supposed to be. Stop being an asshole because people like you who want polite, direct and open minded communication are assholes according to us and people who want manipulation, unnecessary power and issues are just pure awesome.” People use manipulative behaviour because they are afraid of being wrong, embarrassed in the moment or indeed to gain power. Everything around us and everything we do is to decrease the complications, not increase them—> being manipulative in any way, shape or form leads to more complications even when it seems easy and you can read any old, even religious text to attest this simple fact. It’s a bug and not a feature of any society or group or person who considers themselves virtuous. Anyone holding onto anything is also capable and encouraged of admitting without prejudice or embarrassment for objective progress 🙏
    
    —> “Do you want to copy Steve Jobs?” 
    
    You cannot copy a person or their life—> which lived with their values is a greater achievement rather than any material processions. No, I do not aspire to copy anyone. For that matter…admiration is a function of learning and not hero worshiping or copying

        Not to be confused with “trying to be a saint” or “not wanting any material things.” Of course…material things play part in making our lives simpler and increase efficiency of the mind space…productivity…but it’s not about wanting “because what this or that person has” or wanting “because I want to show or impress.” Functional materialism to enable freedom of choice…if that’s a thing…well that’s my thing at least.
        
    
    —> “Are you doing this for legacy?” 
    
    Do we remember the name of every dinosaur that achieved something? That’s a joke. Take it easy. Of course we are more evolved…..🤔…yes, definitely more evolved. As an artist, I explore both inner and outer worlds…therefore doing things for the fun of discovery and contribution besides to live with my values knowing that ultimately we are branches of the same tree…part of the universe…the nature 🌌
    
    —> “Some people want you to do what they want while you keep doing what you want.”
    
    STFU unless you want to collaborate, in that case contact directly.
    
    —> “Do you just want to use investors money because you think it grows on money plant?” 
    
    No, I am absolutely aware about their predicaments and the reasons of their apprehensions. At the same time, the proposals presented for any project are as objective as it can be without bias of the situation because in the long term thats inconsequential. Risk has been made apparent with no attempts to conceal any aspects other than protecting the IP 🏄
    
    —> “You told someone that you don’t eat/ drink this or that but then ate/drunk it…how can you do that?! We are in constant shock!” 
    
    I eat + primarily have only ever eaten vegetarian food and eggs, but have not banned anything. Not liking something only means not consuming it frequently but I also like trying different types of foods all the time…you never know what might strike the taste buds unless you try. Also, like anything else I don’t impose my opinion re food on others…everyone should be able to eat/drink according to their own choice and own responsibility 🧑‍🍳
    
    —> “Do you criticise Bollywood or Indian television because you’re envious or “because your dal nahi galli” huh?” 
    
    The feedback is from my perspective and taste…also because along with the mainstream we are capable of making films or content that are explorative in the spirit of both inner and outer diversity while still appealing to the world. Yes, there are people trying to do that and hopefully more of that will be enabled which can also seep into the mainstream. Storytelling is not a template but it’s fine if that’s only my opinion. Indian music and dances are great…I enjoy…you can’t compare Art with others or based on time spent…those are commercial considerations. Satyajit Ray is one of the finest director of all time. Sure, my sensitivities are more attuned to global content without much bias other than originality of vision + narrative….here are some of my fav Bollywood movies—> Mera Naam Joker, Chupke Chupke(1975), Sholay, Mr. India, Hera Pheri(2000), Khabi Haan Khabi Na, Hum Apke Hai Kaun, Jane Bhi Do Yaro, Jo Jita Wohi Sikandar, Andaaz Apna Apna, Vaastav, Hum Dil de Chuke Sanaam, Border, Gadar 1, Jhankaar Beats, Omkara, Taare Zameen Par, Dil Chahta Hai, Bahuballi 1, Chameli, DDLJ. Tv Shows—> Flop Show by Jaspal Bhatti, Dekh Bhai Dekh, Circus, Fauji, Byomkesh Bakshi, Vikram and Bhaital….among others. 🎞️

    —> “Do you think giving all of this clarification will make your life better?” No? 🤣…well 🖖
    
    This is about ‘not being entitled to your random opinion and imposing it as judgement onto others’—> nothing is a matter of random public opinion or preaching. Even any non random opinion is filtered to applicable usefulness. All noise is blocked and attempts to sabotage in any way, shape or form are peacefully neutralised. Don’t confuse any of this with “unfriendliness” or “unpleasantness” I like talking to strangers, say ‘Hi’ in case you spot me in the neighbourhood—> we shall try to keep it simple and real 🙃 🔆 
    
    —> “What are your thoughts about elder care?”
    
    I grew up carrying for elders. They want to be able to take care for themselves. If you are not living your life well then you can’t really care for anyone. If you have personal and professional goals then you empower people at any stage of life to be self responsible and fill in the gaps as required. Maintaining relationships is not a dependable aspect of physical carrying—> which also does not mean to neglect when personal care is required.
    
    —> “What is your problem with the system? Why do you keep talking about it? That’s governments job.”
    
    By the people, of the people, for the people and my own addition “with the people.” Systems don’t change on their own. Government is made up of older people mostly who are set in their patterns or even the younger ones with tired old patterns. I was not particularly talking about governing system when developing movies or VR/AR. This primarily started with practical research in blockchain and Artificial Intelligence because both domains will have major impact on governing systems, these will be the primary technologies future systems will incorporate. Therefore, you can’t and shouldn’t refrain from thinking, researching, talking and developing systems of any kind as long as it makes sense. But if you lack common sense or foundational knowledge then just do your thing and let me do mine.
    
    —> “You can be contradictory sometimes which makes it difficult to put a pin on your views.”
    
    I think objectively, it’s not contradictory for the sake of being contradictory. If you block your mindset to only a single pattern of thinking then you will find it hard pressed to think originally. For example—> I am totally in favour of political systems being democratic and electoral but that does not mean you cannot improve those systems. Those who are only looking to take advantage rather than improve are restricted in their mindset.
    
    Another example—> if I am listening to a crypto podcast that does not mean I am working on a crypto project or I am Satoshi! lol. It’s not about way ward thinking or sticking to whatever you want to be true but analysing and improving which takes a lot of work in considering logical perspectives.
    
    We live in a world where if you support LGBTQ as a straight single person then you are unnecessarily labelled gay but if you don’t support then you are labelled homophobe or bigoted. You can’t win over trolls because their whole point is to find ways to troll like politicians and their supporters.
    
    If you support Israel, it does not mean you are against a peaceful Palestine state that can coexist alongside with Israel but without harbouring terrorist mindset. Why is this controversial?
    
    If you say that Israel should be careful in its conduct during action in Gaza which means following human rights and making sure humans have food + water, it does not mean you are against Jewish people, you can’t just win on the field when you need to win hearts for long term peace. Why is this controversial?
    
    If you say that we need transparency and process based order in matters of governance so that no issue small or big becomes a matter of any individual’s intuition or ego. What’s controversial in that?
    
    How is saying that elections should be free and fair is supporting any particular political party or person? If you can’t have free and fair elections then you can’t do anything free and fair from that point onwards. Whats controversial in that?
    
    If you are faithful in love and don’t give up because it’s a feeling in your heart based on trust. Your heart obviously has a connection and knows more than some random person with stupid perception or half baked theories. What’s controversial in that?
    
    If you have belief in your abilities and skills based on research to risk your time and reputation then you can earn money by doing 100 other things than what’s controversial in banking on your own self?
    
    There are no rules to life other than human rights and animal rights, everything else is what societies use to organise themselves. If you are respectful of different cultures, ancestors and the global society without having a superiority complex to keep blowing your own horn rather than focusing on contributing to help keep this civilisation sustain. What’s controversial about that?
    
    What’s controversial about being aware about ‘balance’ in all matters of life? 
    
    You can’t think from the perspective of fascist thinking, but open minded exploration through first principles.
    
    —> “Do you often say half truths?”
    
    What does that even mean?! A third person’s lack of understanding about a subject does not define the truth.
    
    “Complete truth” is not that suits narrative of some random person. If you want to understand any situation in more depth than contact the concerned directly. Truth is not told ‘on purpose’ but for clarity between those involved. This term seems divisive to force a perspective for the sake of starting an argument.
    
    —> “What is your problem with Elites?”
    
    I have no problem with anyone in particular. Being an “elite” is not an identity, not a sensible one, anyway. 
    
    Speaking radical truth about systems comes with offending people who benefit from flawed systems if they do not want to improve and don’t appreciate honesty. They have pseudo intellectual excuses like “this is not the right time for honesty.”
    
    Capitalist economies are made for people to make money, its fine to make money as long as you do not come in the way of new ideas by promoting a protectionist mindset and become a hurdle in improving the system that can benefit more and more people. Those who think of themselves as “elites” have low intellectual capacity, therefore, low self worth and wider radius of envy. You can have a lot of money or power and still not conduct yourself with an “elitist” mindset.
    
    Anyone into economic protectionism in a capitalist economy even with lot of money or power is a socialist by mindset and for the 100000th time—> socialism failed, everything is working because global economy adapted principles of capitalism. 
    
    Those promoting socialist agendas within capitalist systems or averse to evolving capitalist systems are socialist elites with capital and not bright because their core thinking is unsustainable—> hypocrites.
    
    As writer, software and AI developer, film maker its natural to talk and build systems that are closer to solving the ground truth, rather than exist in the bubble of “elites.”
    
    —> What are your views about transgenders?
    
    I don’t think about this topic much. We are not talking about pop culture image of gender stereotypes here, but only about biological science—> men are men, women are women, transgender are transgender. There should be no discrimination against anyone based on their gender. Anyone practising their gender without it being imposed on others is fair. As long as people accept themselves, external validation should not be the main focus of these subjects. I understand it’s difficult for many transgender people, we shall practice compassion and empathy to reduce discrimination in all facets of society.
    
    —> What are your views about woke culture?
    
    Cancelling people is wrong and ridiculous. Wokism is the most stereotypical form of commonality practice to control free thoughts, masked as equality imposed by self appointed social justice groups, actually driven by incentives. It’s as prevalent on the ‘right’, as on the ‘left,’ though on the ‘right’ they have their own masks to impose on free thinking. We should focus on making communication better—> honesty over incentivised hypocrisy. Humour is humour. You know when someone is having fun, and when someone is insulting you, they are not the same unless you want to confuse it. Controlling people at the “thought level” is a zero sum game, we need to communicate with others for progress, rather than impose in any form. 
    
    Also, if someone is offended, they need to realise and accept it being a personal emotion which has nothing to do with another person. They should seek clarity with direct and honest communication, rather than offensive action.
