> None of these essays are for the sake of cancelling anyone. Along with technology and other subject matters, this author also writes fiction across genres and advises to not confuse sci-fi or any other fictional content with real world scenarios because that would be plain stupid. It’s totally upto the reader/ audience’s discretion to interpret any content without any liability to the author. Any updates shall be mentioned with a date of the updation. I have a local copy of all these essays to compare against downloaded on the day of publishing, incase of a glitch on notion.

- Additional Details
    
    The above is not a list of all the authors I admire, it’s just few of the best ever in those genre’s to make a point. I have read and follow some amazing authors on social media, writing in different formats that you should check out. There are authors I don’t follow on social media and they are still great. Someday, will make an exhaustive list.
    
    Reading a book is not something I can do as a side activity, it occupies all my senses and for a while after reading. Unless, it needs to be read to find a specific information, therefore, I chose carefully and based on the schedule.
