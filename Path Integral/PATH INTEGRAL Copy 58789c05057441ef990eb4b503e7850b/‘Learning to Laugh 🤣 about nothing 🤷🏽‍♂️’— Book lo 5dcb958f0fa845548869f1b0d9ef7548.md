# ‘Learning to Laugh 🤣 about nothing 🤷🏽‍♂️’—> Book looking for a publisher

1st April 2024 

Even though I am finding it tough to get one book off the ground or maybe its a blessing to be in touch with the ground truth compared to many people who are detached and living in their own make belief.

But one can never stop trying to make something of the cards dealt in a blind poker game of life—> in that spirit.

This is like the forever side project, and not parallel to the other main projects.

Maybe, we can capture some of the lightning with a slight twist of fate in the Speculative Fiction genre. Forever suspended in time and space.

I won’t be writing the actual book here but the updates, snippets and jokes. Kind of ironically fitting to put it out there on April Fool’s day!
