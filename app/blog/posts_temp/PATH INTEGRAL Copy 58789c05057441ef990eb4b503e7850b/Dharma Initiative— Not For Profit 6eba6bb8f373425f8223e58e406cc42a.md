Dharma could mean ‘law’ though there’s no exact translation of the Sanskrit work Dharm, let’s call it the ‘law of kindness’ for our purpose. This is a Kindness Initiative.

The problem—> do we need system based actionable empathy? Which does not mean you call someone for help in this context but availability and access to opportunities for anyone. To make responsible capitalism work for everyone in the face of Climate Change, AI and other challenges as advised by the official text of each country known as the constitution. 

The goal—> build an evolving machine of human interdependence that can minimise dependence on exploitative individuals or groups. I believe this can solve many societal problems including help with mental health issues and will write out a thesis when we are closer to starting work on this. Not looking to do everything on our own either but share tech solutions with other non profits with diverse missions to make real impact.

Vision—> take society a rung up from its current state with equitable share for all its inhabitants at the base layer. Nothing to do with socialism or EA or communism.

Opposite of cults, in a way—> now, this idea or the implementation can suck but there’s a chance it can be great or at least the science and engineering can be useful for taking things forward.

You need to understand how the world actually works rather than “how it works as per the convenience of some people.” 

Let me tell you the reason I want to build this—> because i want NO one to be in the position i am at. I don’t want future generations in the position of the kid on the street with a dubious future in front of him or her but still being judged and not helped. This is not charity, not vanity, it’s really about wanting to better use our collective time and resources.

The amount of privileges someone has in this world divided by the proportion of curiosity, interests, empathy, laziness and learning ability ascertains if they want things to be better or not. There’s nothing wrong with privilege of any kind, it just plays an important role in forming a person’s world view and mindset. If the proportion of your privilege is greater than any of those other attributes along with proportional ratio of these attributes to each other than you are less and less inclined to build better systems because things are already “working in your favour.”

Read that ☝️ again.

Inability to know and understand your own self creates these imbalances and each imbalance leads to a faulty world view. It’s not easy to understand this, so their’s no blame on anyone.

To build things from the perspective of only maximising your current position rather than improving the underlying function does not makes things better. So, while there are plenty of people doing that, there are also plenty of people who find it difficult to find the trajectory of a stable position in their life to then think of even small maximisation of their living standards which does not mean overuse or wasting resources.

We don’t want opportunity itself or related rewards to be uncertain. Taking a capitalist + technical approach to this problem. It’s about raising people from Dinner money—> to a stable life situation if they keep doing the work.

It shouldn’t be a question of “If I do this, will I get this return?” at the most basic level. It’s universal access to certain opportunity and reward which can sustainably improve individual, family and overall standard of life and mindfulness on Earth without being dependent on corrosive social entities or cults. 

We won’t be looking for praise or following, you do your work and focus on making your life better rather than toeing the line. That’s for your belief in god and values to become a better citizen as per the constitution of the respective country in accordance with universal human rights.

This is a separate initiative from other commercial projects.
