Don‚Äôt assume‚Äî> ask. Be light and civil. Humour is a regular part of communication, take it easy.*
    
    Clear your assumptions beforehand, prefer no *[commotion](Ventures%E2%80%94%20AI%20Native%20Game%20Engine%20692cd876d32e4108bc0839b384ecd66e.md) after we have agreed and started.
    
    Colours anywhere on this portal don‚Äôt represent any ideology or anything else other than to manage attention. In fact, i don‚Äôt follow any ideology offline either, just saying because of the politics these days around the world. Most of my decisions online or offline are primarily based on humanistic values or capitalist concerns like how much money and time is in my pocket.

- Notes üìù
    
    
    Nothing mentioned here is financial, personal or political advice by default‚Äî> kindly, use your own good wisdom before making any decisions along with consulting respective national or international institutions. 
    
    Location preference‚Äî> Hybrid, though happy to be in location for an agreed + set period of time anywhere in the world‚Äî> nomad travelling and moving from place to place ‚úàÔ∏è¬†as a tool for optimal performance. Discuss directly rather than reaching conclusions.
    
    1.0‚Äî> Not too much thought has been given to specifically color coding every paragraph. Color coding has been done primarily to make it easier to read. Don‚Äôt draw over thought out conclusions from the color.
    
    2.0‚Äî> The story and all its aspects are fictional. The facts about the production + the tech or any statements are as stated on this page. Therefore, nothing is coded with double or triple meaning and is definitely not representative of ‚Äúthe illuminati.‚Äù Incase, something seems too complicated to understand than ask questions as advised multiple times here rather than making assumptions and try to clean your thinking.
    
    3.0‚Äî> When talking about technology + related aspects like economic models + anything product related‚Äî> nothing is a prophesy or a ‚Äúno matter what‚Äù approach. Happy to talk with different stakeholders to figure things at different stages because that is how products are built. This does not mean indulging with anyone who thinks of themselves as ‚Äústakeholder.‚Äù
    
    4.0‚Äî> It‚Äôs not a common practice to publish movie scripts before hand because the whole idea is to make movies out of it. Also, depending on the style it might take some effort to grasp if not used to reading scripts or used to reading specific type of scripts. Which does not mean the work has not been done and the scripts are no longer private anyway but at least you can get to read the latest version if requested directly.

### Script Reviews

***‚ÄúThe story is unlike anything currently on the market for children. It represents a different culture to American norms, celebrates STEM and has a fun alien hook. This story would likely do well on the market with the right creative direction.‚Äù   ~Blcklst Scripts***

***‚ÄúHEX is a fun and entertaining sci-fi adventure‚Ä¶the Setting stands out, and the endearing, diverse character lead us through a family friendly story. The audience should find the dancing robots fun, and the serious child characters engaging.
