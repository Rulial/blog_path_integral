Why are you making this movie?

I believe everyone should make projects to their strengths based on the optimal use of their skills. Storytelling is my core skill and prime motivation. 

A story is everything from a tech company taking over the world to Steve Jobs comeback with Pixar and then the iPhone, to any political party, the human race, the future voyage to mars on a SpaceX rocket, the spread of the pandemic, religion, economy and in this case the inner strength of two children, odds stacked against them fighting a genius crazy billionaire with all the resources in the world. It's about practical hope, that is how we want to start our journey, by connecting with the last person and not only with the status quo.

Why are we not making this movie in the traditional way like all the other movies? 

Movie-making has become an industrialized hegemony of corporate overlords trying to make a ‚Äúpenny‚Äù out of a dollar at the cost of stifling creativity, vision, experimentation and good storytelling. Following templates for every genre results in movies that are templates, and when something original seeps through the ranks like 'The Parasite' it grabs the world's attention. You can argue that the machine is working and more good content with high production value has been produced than ever before, especially when what constitutes good content is subjective to the demographic and audience. 

The fact is, we are not in the position of Pixar or with a body of work on which the high brass would justify the risk of their reputation, because this is a risk, and the gods of the filmdom usually reserve that capacity of taking the risk for friends or someone who's made through their pipeline of asskissing jagron. 

We are not saying all these people working in the current system are bad; on the contrary, we are saying they do not have a choice because most talent only chooses from the options presented to them by the established order. 

We are in a position to build an alternative pipeline, rather than a zero-sum game, a game of positive gain, and would love for anyone from the other side to come over to build their own projects once we have proven that there is no one way of doing things; they have more choices than they are aware.

Why is the financial model proposed to make this movie along with the Metaverse better than traditional models? 

+ 

Why not only make the movie and not the metaverse property or vice versa? 

Our financial model is providing more value to the users $ on $.

The traditional movie business model is to put finance together for a movie in a mix of equity, credit and tax rebates, whether it's Netflix or an independent producer, with variations that are not vitally important in this context. Of course, Netflix has an advantage over any independent producer because their primary motivation behind making the movie is not to profit from that piece of content in a straight-forward way but to retain current or gain new subscribers. 

There are still other models, though more or less all of them are skewing towards the Netflix way of doing things with variations in strategy for theatrical release or franchises that could be highly profitable from merchandising or building universes to sell further content on that same property. Like we stressed earlier, it's good to have differences; their model is not the only play. Our model is not the only play; the beauty is in having a choice to make the best version of your story to optimal quality. 

If I was making a live action love story then I can still use the decentralised crypto-financial part of this ecosystem but not necessarily have to also develop a Metagame, and vice versa;

To stress the importance of a modular and autonomous ecosystem where all the stories do not need to have a metaverse property, no; the complete model works for stories like HEX which from inception is suited as a metaverse game along with being a movie. Though, the idea behind the metagame is for the stories to self-originate and evolve inside the metaverse with their own economies, but we shall circle back to that point in a different piece. 

At the same time we are minimizing the risk for lets say the film does not get the traction we are hoping for at the onset than compared with the traditional film finance model we would have still burned less monies while retaining the community because of added benefits least of which is the financial gains or income they can make in the Metaverse.

While entertainment being the primary reason they join, that would not be the only reason they would stay unlike corporate communities with marketing as the prime derivative but to pursue their interests in different forms of Metagame engagement or developing projects of their own.

How will an investor benefit from early participation in this project? 

Here we are only talking about investment in the film but we would be using the same token as for other development inc; the metaverse based on the metagame;

For example- if you have bought tokens worth $100 as an investment in the film, the value is not based on the performance of that one project; your gains would be more than only monetary but from the value generated by the entire ecosystem.

What is the metaverse?

Please read our [Metagame thesis](../Words%E2%80%94%20Long%20Form%20ed8500f5e08243f5b8796bfe35f8878d/METAGAME%20OF%20THE%20METAVERSE%E2%80%94%20Research%2033c0aeda17d44d5997e081c7cefa8d97.md).

It seems like you have not shipped a note-worthy product of your own; with that in mind, why should we support you? 

Everything I have been doing has led to this; there's no failure- we either win or learn, and I have been learning to make this a note-worthy product.

Every tom, dick and harry is making a metaverse. Why should we back your project? 

This page deals with the investment in Hex, the film, though you will be buying into the ecosystem that is building the metagame-based metaverse. You have a choice based on the details here for long term community-based value creation in a transparent ecosystem to make this your own project.

How will you ensure this venture stays on a growth trajectory rather than imploding due to creative impulses? 

Corporate honchos are brainwashed to believe that creativity is something to be afraid of but even if that shall be the case, the ecosystem is being built on science and technology, details of which are open for the community, the movie is being made based on the strength of the script and the story- nothing is more essential for an animated film. The decentralised nature of the platform would protect the community from any individual impulses.

---

What gives you an advantage over more established gaming companies, animation studios and The Metaverse startups that already have seasoned professionals or massive funding?

They don't have a blinking idea about what's to come; not due to lack of capabilities; in fact they might be more capable in some aspects but because of incredible ignorance and egos to make the changes that are relevant to society today or will be in the future, their energy is spent on keeping the status quo while we are focusing on spreading the resources on merit for the talent and users to reach their full potential, therefore, pushing the boundaries with the product to become an optimal tool for the community based use cases.

There are rumors about your reputation; do you care to explain yourself? 

I am making a movie about two street kids learning robotics to fight a genius crazy billionaire other than a decentralised metaverse. Everyone has a right to their opinion; you can reserve yours based on personal interaction. I do have flaws; it's not about avoiding contradictions but acknowledging them.

Why don't you have a working prototype of the metagame or the metaverse?

We have a well reviewed script for the film which is the main subject matter of this presentation.

Even a prototype of the Metagame would need significant resources and brilliant people to lend their skills so as to make an optimal version which might still be flawed. But even to make the best flawed prototype rather than being satisfied by something hasty that is not the intended implementation is a challenge at the moment equivalent to playing music in outer space; its about hitting the first string; after that it's all demonstrable. 

We are seeking a separate seed round for this purpose with a 3 month timeline to build the Metagame prototype v 0.1
