    - Notes 📝
        
        I don’t represent anyone or anything other than myself 🤷‍♂️. No association with any group either. It’s only myself. “We” is used in the context of representing Path Integral, even though at the moment all this is a SOLOPENUER venture.
        
        1.0—> Nothing mentioned here is financial, personal or political advice by default—> kindly, use your own good wisdom before making any decisions along with consulting respective national or international institutions. 
        
        2.0—> Location preference. Hybrid, though happy to be in location for an agreed + set period of time anywhere in the world. Travelling and moving between places ✈️ as a tool for optimal performance—> happy to discuss custom arrangements.
        
        3.0—> When talking about technology + related aspects like economic models + anything product related—> nothing is a prophesy or a “no matter what” approach. Happy to talk with different stakeholders to figure things at different stages because that is how products are built. This does not mean indulging with anyone who thinks of themselves as “stakeholder.”
        
        4.0—> There are no centralised or decentralised limits to my movement, willing to happily co-operate without prejudice in finding solutions in case of any confusion. If no positive resolution can be reached, unlawful or unconstitutional restrictions will be challenged with applicable legal action.
        
        5.0—> Along with “rules of the human kingdom 🥰” I and by that effect Path Integral is respectful of national + international laws and regulations though also expect flexible, swift and solution led approach by counter parties.
        
        6.0—> Heard from someone gathering references that something about my experience listed on LinkedIn is not correct. Anyone who wants to challenge anything in there can write directly for a response with facts.
        
        7.0—> Colours anywhere on this portal don’t represent any ideology or anything else other than to manage attention. In fact, i don’t follow any ideology offline either, just saying because of the politics these days around the world. Most of my decisions online or offline are primarily based on humanistic values or capitalist concerns like how much money and time is in my pocket.
        
        8.0—> This page has nothing to do with fiction writing, therefore, nothing is coded with double or triple meaning and is definitely not representative of “the illuminati” lol. Incase, something seems too complicated to understand than ask questions as advised multiple times here rather than making assumptions and try to clean your own thinking.
        
        - Previously Learning/ Reading 👓
            
            —> Have been following the Deep Mind’s research for years to form a philosophical understanding for use in Narrative Writing though got into implementable AI last year after finding a base technical logic. Not a trained programmer but I have been self learning and running logic based experiments since the start of my career in VFX/ Computer Vision.

            On a continuous learning course of reading more than 200 papers/ documents for research—> Refining my intermediate knowledge of R, Python and other languages via single subject and detailed lessons of machine and deep learning on *Kaggle, Hugging face, Open AI* and other resources as a beginner.
            
            I don’t watch any videos tutorials to learn any particular subject and its fine those who do learn from watching video tutorials. Personally I find thinking, reading, writing and interactive applications as better learning techniques.
            
            Running Colabs of various demos put together by amazing researchers and programmers while working on original research you can find more about [here](Research%20Projects%E2%80%94%20Book%20looking%20for%20a%20publisher%205a29ceea5bf54f64a6d4dc6f91a60357.md) and as a short term side project also developing an adaptive Gen AI animation pipeline for [this](HEX%E2%80%94%20Animated%20Feature%20Film%20fa053ecef00347c29d30b490984801bc.md) among other potential use cases.
            
    - Thought Put 🤷🏽‍♂️
        
        > ‘Out There’ obviously inspired by Star Trek is not a single particular destination but a journey among infinite possibilities.

        > “What is culture?”
        > 
        > 
        > A shared mechanism to honestly communicate the immense beauty of life among communities and individuals, across generations, based in their origin. It’s organic art that needs to breath and evolve with us.
        > 
        
        > Scientific method and common sense evolve with time. Restrictions on the other hand are insecurities of self proclaimed cultural saviours who don’t actually understand culture.
        > 
        
        > If you really understand nature of complexity then try to make things variably simple which does not mean to fit any hypothesis as you interpret but as close to its optimal nature as possible.
        > 
        
        > There is no “pivot” from “this to that”—> wisdom is continuously upgrading knowledge to level up towards multiple outputs with better tools.
        > 
        
        > Whenever it is said or at least whenever I say “future of this or that” it is not predicting how the whole world or industry will magically adapt my proposed approach—> all I am trying to communicate with this wording is the potential of the said approach which will have to prove itself out there. Also, the future is no singular product or thesis, there are many futures, every person on earth is a bright future looking for an opportunity…just that sometimes we have to create the opportunity itself.
        > 
        
        > If you hear any false rumours by competition, envious/ disgruntled ex associates or random bad actors and base your judgment on that to form an opinion without taking direct input—> well, as one of my friends would say “think about it” and don’t do that.
        > 
        
        > All critical thought is not criticism—> prefer giving private feedback depending on having private access. No feedback is general, that applies to everyone in the same profession or related fields. If you are taking any unintended offence that’s your own insecurity and the same applies to myself.
        > 
    
    *****Direct with variable simplicity**—> Objectivity with flexibility to consider any perspective.
    
    If i have emailed/ messaged you —> clear path for communication. 😎
    
    Don’t hesitate to contact first if you find any interest —> **not playing any power games.**
    
    Nothing is done to “impress” or “appeasement”—> ideas to life 💡
    
    *NO stunts. You are advised to declare any unsaid advantages before we can do business—> NO generalised advice —> everything is said or done under certain context and not in “absoluteness” but means as written in the most simple translation from words to logic. Don’t assume—> ask. Be light and civil. Humour is a regular part of communication, take it easy.*
    
    Clear your assumptions beforehand, prefer no *[commotion](Ventures%E2%80%94%20AI%20Native%20Game%20Engine%20692cd876d32e4108bc0839b384ecd66e.md) after we have agreed and started.

AGI research is canceled due to various technical reasons—> being principally right on an early trajectory could still mean seemingly lost in science fiction without any recourse to an outcome. This has been very educational and knowledgeable. 

*Longterm status—> Hypothesis —> Conjecture —> Proof Prototype —> Product.

**Current form of the hypothesis? Logical—> Building Conjecture.

    —> “Why do you need proper resources? Can’t you just complete this research on your own sitting in a hotel room or a cafe or a bar if this gets too demanding?” Let me try to answer this without sarcasm…..no. 
    

***Clarity—> this is still only a hypothesis and currently at an impasse due to lack of resources for RnD and might only end up being another component rather than the whole machine, if it works. There have been many hypothesis in this field, therefore, a process with minimum gap between theory and experimentation is important for iteration and progress. This is not down playing or over playing but trying to be authentic + realistic in our own expectations based on technical understanding of the subject matter—> which is extremely important rather than approaching this with a bloated mindset.

- Additional Context
    
    Not worth making assumptions, bringing unnecessary arguments or hysteria or groups of people for/ against making this about pride or legacy and infringe on freedom of choice. Things get done by not trying to control the outcome from the onset but by treading lightly.
    

A?I is harmful or will take over human jobs or civilisation is an ignorant assumption + irresponsible claims without understanding technical details—> happy to address any confusion upon completion of the prototype. Not a “guess” but based on logical reasoning.

There are more chances of misuse/ mismanagement than “misalignment” for something that is not A?I. Have been factoring any real dangers of A?I into the research from the onset to solve those problems with technical solutions rather than with drama. There are no claims—> experiments will be self evident of success or failure.

Any argument dismissing or discouraging research because others think this is impossible or because of economic interests in older technology is not scientific thinking but is definitely idiotic—> similar arguments were presented for why airplanes won’t fly, man won’t land on the moon or more recently Falcon 9 would not be a reusable rocket.

*****RESEARCH BASE ← → exploring consciousness through technical logic in complex systems ← → behavioural science as subject for more than a decade of seeking clarity from philosophical absurdities ← → narrative analogies ← → building understanding of the universe via theoretical physics ← → exciting challenge is to optimally implement inside an evolving computer science framework.

Mathematics is logical communication. Computer Programming is functional communication. Design is actionable communication. ‘Imagination and Creativity’ even though not bound to any particular process are implementable in any form via aligned input —> output of the above three languages.

*Blockchain is a building block used for utility features and not a profile page template based “crypto social network.” Also, everything is some form of play though just because this is called Meta’game’—> it’s not a literal “video game.”*

Baseline structures with versatile architecture are important for any evolutionary product to scale with purpose and optimally adapt without breaking in the face of new inventions.

The goal is to explore depths of both outer and inner space—> brace yourself with responsibility.
