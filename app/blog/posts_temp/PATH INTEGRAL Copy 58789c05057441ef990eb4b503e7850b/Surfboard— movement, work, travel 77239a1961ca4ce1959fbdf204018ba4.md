    I recommend reading these—> [Words—> Long Form](Words%E2%80%94%20Long%20Form%20ed8500f5e08243f5b8796bfe35f8878d.md) 
    
    This is where I try to feel important by asking all these questions of myself based on general feedback collected from the internet. You’re welcome. 
    
    Say something—> not having bags full of money in the bank does not mean I am mentally, spiritually or professionally where you expect “i should be” which is not “superior” to anyone but in actionable mode, therefore, it would help to further matters if ego is left at your own door.
    
    —> “Why are you working on current projects?” 
    
    To build things that can provide logical and artistic value by default rather than being driven primarily by traction—> ‘primarily’ is an imp word because everything needs traction. Subjectively, these products make lives better, that’s intentional to serve objectivity, not for the sake of being noble or kind but for being more functional than promotional because traction is difficult. Not a dis on any person, product or company because they are doing something I should learn. The world is big with space and requirement for everything. 🕊️
    
    —> “What kind of investors/ business partners/ colleagues are you looking for? While we understand any exact specification is useless though a general guideline for any project.” 
    
    Healthy, clear and independent thinking without being distorted by the noise of the past, present and future + to know the difference between Technology—> Product—> Advertising—> Marketing—> Sales is vital along with being aware to not confuse those for subjective benefit or greed in the most mundane sense. Don’t be attached to your biases even if not able to self correct.
    
    Each person has their own subjective view of reality but working on a common goal means constructing a persistent + objective view of reality while bringing awareness and insights from our subjectivity to keep updating this common page using optimal communication—> forming an understanding that prevents rest of the team from drifting away from the page realising eventually our customers/ audience will be sharing our dreams.
    
    Lightness in attitude and wanting to get things done with openness but realising the importance of being based in first principles and having a genuine interest in discovery. While it is absolutely alright to not know, no one knows everything but having a mindset + developing abilities to unlearn and learn within the limits is important for expanding the horizon. You should be able to call spade, a spade—> emotional intelligence ♠️👀
    
    - Additional context
        
        Honesty is the only route to emotional intelligence, the first person you have to be honest with is yourself.
        
        Everything else is emotional manipulation, the first person you manipulate is yourself.
        
    
    —> “Do you want to be a trillionaire?” 
    
    No one is becoming that! Only a small part of the machinery once we get started. Frugal and minimalist with a lifestyle of abundant choices rather than irrational compulsion which includes spending but not over spending 😌
    
    —> “Why don’t you socialise more as that will help find investment leads?” 
    
    I love meeting people, new, even strangers and not necessarily like minded either because listening + consideration of different perspectives is important for a healthy mind. Though, it does not mean I would do business with everyone or anyone especially on passion based ventures because if our values don’t align then the journey won’t align, therefore the outcomes won’t deliver. 
    
    When it comes to active projects, I only like to talk as means of functional progress—> rather than spending endless energy in making impressions or finding equilibrium in wayward + mostly unnecessary power equations—> that’s not my primary role as an artist. We are making dreams here man and I am extremely easy to find 🍺
    
    —> “Are you looking for shortcuts to get rich quick?” 
    
    Super duper quick. What is your concern? That’s verbiage of those envious of other people’s progress. Financial security is a foundation to do great work and not “being Rich,” only an entitled person would confuse earlier with the later. Mostly, this type of thinking is result of an institutionalised mindset which considers progress and growth as privileges reserved for a few. But like one of my friend says—>

    We dance without the burden of anyone’s hypocrisy 💃🕺
    
    —> “What is the role of a Founder in a startup?”
    
    Founder’s ideas are not supreme and at the same time are no one’s ideas. If you have a better idea that should be adopted than prove it—> imagination, logic, diverse perspectives with nuance, long term value, embracing contradictions of experience; think in those terms rather than “power, expertisome, greed, fame and glory.” No one thinks of Edison or Tesla every time lighting the electric bulb—> take it easy, keep is real 💫
    
    —> “If you are so smart then why not make it all yourself?” 
    
    If not being stupid is smart; trying to sound humble. Have you tried humour? Find me a person who’s completely flawless and “content.” Every life has its own path. By the way, anyone who wants to have a coding competition—> give me a heads up as i need to tune my senses and we can go. Most probably I will lose but let’s learn! Being proud for what you do but don’t understand when people tie their identity to acquired skills- yes, any skill can be acquired and if you focus on it with a purpose, excellence or failure can be found because absurdity of life. Everyone is more than what they do! Nothing worthwhile can be made alone 🤝
    
    —> “What are your thoughts about compliments and praise?” 
    
    *Expect meaning from google—> regard (someone) as likely to do or be something.*
    
    We need to understand the difference between compliment and praise. 
    
    *Compliment from google—> a [polite](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=592174923&hl=en-gb&sxsrf=AM9HkKn6G4XzkVq_Ylng7VEMMmFJy5lUXQ:1702987817205&q=polite&si=ALGXSlaWqc4XvKuO31AnQ7gAsIq_7uvdvwepGOgdCrtbTq_VjGfRPWj9mXYLm6QX0fl0pd4kseh8Jh2YVBKEziJ-vH1ekXP_aQ%3D%3D&expnd=1) expression of praise or [admiration](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=592174923&hl=en-gb&sxsrf=AM9HkKn6G4XzkVq_Ylng7VEMMmFJy5lUXQ:1702987817205&q=admiration&si=ALGXSlbnOEZPfHsS2MaPJwdaOxE_kVevfGsUrFKJ2za_9vp7XUm_uMW61YxPTLRJlpMIJ4Phr6sDgWTtgONXX7oz_bkuUJFm54nYEsG2IJ4goWjKAInjneM%3D&expnd=1). For me, this is in the instant. Complimenting when someone is wearing a nice tie.*
    
    *Praise from google—> express warm approval or [admiration](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=592174923&hl=en-gb&sxsrf=AM9HkKki0JGf1wKEel-upq184FsrzpCVyQ:1702987809999&q=admiration&si=ALGXSlbnOEZPfHsS2MaPJwdaOxE_kVevfGsUrFKJ2za_9vp7XUm_uMW61YxPTLRJlpMIJ4Phr6sDgWTtgONXX7oz_bkuUJFm54nYEsG2IJ4goWjKAInjneM%3D&expnd=1) of. For me, this is after well thought out like praising someone for having a great choice in ties.*
    
    Also, all this is how i personally conduct and not how I ‘expect’ others to conduct.
    
    I compliment people ALL the time, that is honest in the moment admiration which leads to positive interactions.
    
    “Your suit or dress or saree is looking great”
    
    “You are doing good work” —> but this does not cancels if the same person has done or is doing something wrong. 
    
    “You are taking steps in the right direction” —> but i can’t predict the steps they are going to take in the future or even in the next moment. I sure do hope and will praise again at the right time.
    
    “That looks like a good strategy” —> but we will know if this strategy works or not. Therefore, praising someone for having a good strategy does not mean you are praising them for the result. It’s like predicting what shape a cloud would take in 40 hours because right now it looks like a Kangaroo—> i don’t know!
    
    “This dish tastes really good” —> admiration but it’s not a compliment for a dish the same chef is going to make in the future. 
    
    “You are an amazing chef” —> it’s praise but not complimenting the dish they are preparing without tasting it though I am expecting the dish to be great. 
    
    If an architect designed The Empire State Building, it does not mean everything they are doing to design is going to be just as good by default.
    
    I realise there are people who are constantly expecting to hear over the top praises like “you are the greatest” “you are doing everything right” “you can’t take a wrong step” or even “you are god like” —> I just can’t do that in good conscience. 
    
    This does not apply to any kind of sports or performance arts because naturally you are praising something that has already happened, but unlike a ‘performative field’ which needs to be constantly applied and still results can only be assessed in the long term. But a performance lives forever. 
    
    For example—> A great movie is always great even if exactly the same bunch of people make a subsequent “bad” movie. 
    
    A great song is always great even if the same performer has a “bad” song. 
    
    A great product is always great even if the same team subsequently makes a “bad” product. 
    
    Future performance does not invalidate past performances in sports or performance arts or chefs or many fields, but it does not apply to every field. 
    
    Performative fields like politics are more challenging in that sense and not complimenting a politician is not personal. That’s why politicians need to have thicker skin than artists. 
    
    It’s like you laughed at a joke and meet the same person again a day after but not laughing anymore but this offends this person. Does that make sense? Like, take it easy.
    
    Praise is always for the stuff someone has done in the past, even for something they are doing currently—> praise is past tense only, there cannot be praise for future work. It’s not my personal rule, that’s how nature works! 
    
    Hence, if i have already praised someone for their past work, what is the point of me praising them for the same work again and again, everyday? Someone might need to promote their own work on a daily basis but thats their job, it’s not my job or duty to promote or praise anyone everyday—> i don’t even want any job where i would need to praise someone everyday, multiple times a day ‘out of obligation’ rather than thinking about something useful or implementing—> This should not be confused with talking or discussing which has nothing to do with selective praising or complementing or criticising.
    
    If someone is more worried about not being constantly praised rather than focusing on their job then that should be a sure cause for concern for themselves.
    
    When I compliment my future wife that she’s the most beautiful women in the world is a personal compliment from myself to her, its between us. If some other person does not share that same sentiment, both of us are not going to fight with them because that would be crazy and a total waste of our time. Try to apply this example to other situations especially in business or politics.
    
    Again, being nuanced helps—> praising someone’s career even in politics or business is something I do. It’s obviously past tense, for decisions they have already made and there’s enough proper data to analyse the performance. 
    
    Not same as someone still in their job because I don’t want to make them complacent either or in case of public interaction, don’t want to give an impression that this person can’t do anything wrong because anyone can make mistakes and are capable of doing wrong.
    
    Not trying to be above anyone though, i just don’t EXPECT over the top praise or compliments from anyone. It fine when someone compliments and sure feels good for a moment but I like to quickly remind myself about it being past tense, to not get complacent in the present.
    
    There’s a vibe and understanding when talking to friends or family, you know this compliment or praise is only in the moment or we are kidding around if something feels over the top.

    —> “Why did you not take covid vaccine?”
    
    I have complete trust in the medical researchers and scientists who did great work in a short time to save many venerable lives across India and the world. The whole production line needs to be complimented for their effort. At the same time, such were the circumstances, they did not get proper time to follow the procedures as they would for any other drug but thats just my own fastidiousness.
    
    I already had covid at least once, so, that’s one more reason, I did not feel the need to take the vaccine. 
    
    I am super extra cautious than most people, so, that’s one more reason, because I would have still taken same precautions even after taking the vaccine.
    
    Anna did not take the vaccine, so, that’s another small reason I did not take it. Can’t let her face any danger alone and I don’t care what anyone else thinks about that. This was NOT a primary reason, but a small motivator.
    
    —> “This is a lot of theory, are you Wikipedia? In fact, we will classify everything you have done as theory because you have not made money. Take practical action.” 
    
    What are you even talking about?! If your hustle works it’s an inspiring story and it’s a joke when it doesn’t, but at least laughter is good for health. You need a script to make a movie, you need a plan to build a business and you need research if making a new product in varying degrees of forms and factors. I have been doing the required, necessary and voluntary for a long time.
    
    Learned it the hard way, but if we are in a collaboration and I am not being paid or its not a fair or tact arrangement, i do my part, don’t do work of the other side or for them, till that is sorted—> this way remaining time and energy can be put into more promising projects. Along with various other factors to keep my mind and mojo healthy. It’s a levels thing, if you don’t get it, you won’t.

    —> “What are your views about the elderly?”
    
    Hypothetically, If whole of my time spent with other people is equal to 100 than I have spent 65 of that with the elderly. 
    
    Experience is not wisdom, but is definitely useful data which can be a good guide when analysed with proper filters.
    
    I like older people, can even manage them, but I don’t want to, like I don’t want to manage anyone because have realised the greatest gift we can give anyone is honesty and freedom to pursue their own expectations. Even the elders. Age is only a number. We all will be old, it’s the cycle of life 🤷🏾‍♂️ and managing builds insecurity while managed support builds trust.
    
    As I am getting older and have already spent a lot of time with the elders, it sought of emerged as a pattern where I would find myself more comfortable with the elderly, therefore, trying to break the pattern in the last few years by trying to interact more with the youth. 
    
    Young people need to balance exuberance in communication and focus more of it on the task. Nobody asked for this, but it’s my two cents/paisa/penny/bits.
    
    —> “How much has been your earnings in financial year 2022-23, 23-24, 24-25?” 
    
    My total combined earnings from all sources of revenue for financial years mentioned above were less than INR 250,000/- that is why I have not filled income tax this financial year, because income tax filing is not mandatory below that amount. Yeah, it’s been a bad few year financially. Though, i have paid indirect taxes relative to all spendings. Like, when travelling on the metro I pay for the ticket + GST, therefore, use of the escalator or walking on the fine marble is justified.
    
    —> “What is the difference between being interdependent and being dependent?” 
    
    Everything in nature that includes us human beings is interdependent on each other, which is beautiful and also reflects in everyday life around the planet to the whole of solar system and the universe. On the other hand being dependent means not being responsible for your own self and actions—> you are outsourcing that responsibility to someone else which is not great. Just talking about myself, as much as possible I try not to depend on others while being interdependent is natural.

        —> “Are you not interested in contributing to your community, especially local community?” 
        
        I don’t litter at all, have not created any menacing situation and neither been part of any unlawful situation where the state would have to spend precious resources. If someone comes to me for help and I am in a position to help, all things considered, however small, I do help without advertising—> those are contributions. 
        
        I am working on projects that when successful—> I will be in a position to take practical initiatives to contribute to the community where i grew up, communities where i have worked and to the people around the world rather than only making appearances for the sake of public relations—> this is not written as general criticism of anyone else. 
        
        There’s already plan with ‘Dharma Initiative’ to extend + augment abilities and serve humanity as best as we can by making practical contribution. But we need to get there and life’s journey is never linear.
        
        Immediacy of irrational thinking can make belief that all contributions are needed to be made right now—> then call every person of Indian origin back to India? Cancel all foreign trips and travel. No, right? That would not make any sense. Much of this type of thinking or actions are known as bullying and everyone can become a noble citizen by trying to show sensibility + empathy towards your local and non local environment.
        
    
    —> “You seem opinionated on certain issues or use criticism to say negative things on those topics?” 
    
    “Opinionated” would be when I am not ready to listen…well, I let people speak and like listening to everyone. It’s not “criticism” or “negative comments” for the sake of it, but calling spade, a spade or sometimes reserving my comments to not indulge because I don’t need to voice my opinion unnecessarily as everything is not made or said for me, but if someone has a problem even with that then its their problem—> correcting them is setting the record straight and not negativity. 
    
    One of the important things I learned from a lady known as Gillian Gordon, Course Director at MA for Producing is a core rule of criticism—> “first say something positive, anything and then give your honest views about the subject at hand.” It is a mix of that and creative thinking + scientific reasoning—> to give constructive feedback is to help people + the cause and not for anything else. 
    
    Also, where should I draw the line on fake compliments if I don’t like a feature in a product or a movie or anything that we use? I analyse between its subjectiveness to myself or being an inherent issue with the product and based on that assessment, feedback is built, then shared. 
    
    For example—> If I’ve said something is not working with twitter at any point, its not because I want to say anything negative about Elon, why the fuck would i waste my time saying anything about him unless I have something to share, like a thought or an idea? I just want the problem fixed or a feature added or to help twitter or i might be talking about a related subject matter. Also, giving feedback about one product does not apply to every other product or every other company he owns. It’s objective feedback shared about a particular issue.
    
    Another example—> if I’ve mentioned “Read Subjectively” its because I don’t want to influence other people on that subject and let them analyse it for themselves. It does not mean I have a negative opinion. Personally, I have no ideology other than the human spirit which is shared with everyone regardless of anything else.
    
    There are number of different personal analytic tools I use to stay objective rather than just saying random things—> other than when its humour 🤣
    
    —> “Reasons for past failures and lessons learned?” 
    
    Many perspectives but no point diving into water under the bridge. Call them mistakes or choices or life…trying to work with same values, ambition and passion but differently. I always admit my mistakes but that does not discount other people’s mistakes, call it luck or something else…details are important—> but everyone is forgiven, all they need to do is forgive themselves and not repeat the mistakes if they can’t correct them. Every second is a lesson, every space is an opportunity and every passing moment is a call to action 🚀
    
    —“Have you ever taken unauthorised substances of any kind at all?” 
    
    No, never felt the need. Naturally cool and weird.
    
    Haven’t taken any body building supplements either—> this is not a negative endorsement…i don’t care what you do with your own body🏋️
    
    —> “We are concerned about your personal life choices.” 
    
    I take complete responsibility for my personal life as conscious decisions that should not directly effect the business and any sensible investor/ business partner would understand unless your philosophy is to control rather than trust or make your opinion based on gossip and rumours < always available for a conversation to address concerns 📢

        —> do you have any inkling what it takes to think deeply, to dive into the void of actual research when working on AI or any kind of actual science, art or engineering? My life is organised around refining my wisdom through knowledge rather than how that looks to you, a third person with no perspective or insight into my way of thinking—> so wtf are you judging?! If you a person who confuses the “usual” with the natural then that is your problem sir or madam. 
        
        —> My personal and public life are separate from my work/ research which is a dimension on its own—> I am completely aware of how to keep them separated, that’s how it’s best lived and should not be fiddled around with by layman.
        
        —> Think about your work as a warehouse or a diamond mine or a painting or mathematics board or a blank paper or rocket manufacturing workshop or a restaurant or programming or coding or travelling salesman or sports team or a teacher or a stock market or hospital or a journalist or a social media platform or a construction company or a general store or a luxury brand store or a security guard or a house maid or career politician or a government official or a small business or a unicorn! 
        
        I wanted to be more specific to drive the point home but for now will just get to the point—> thinking time varies from implementation time in each of those cases, its not the same across the board. 
        
        You need to be equipped to implement well of course but what people don’t realise is that you also need to be equipped to ‘think well—> actionable thinking’ which automatically + efficiently reduces the implementation time. In btw is also ‘communicating well’ but we will discuss that some other day. 
        
        Hard work is when you don’t love what you do and know the outcome like a salary at the end of the month but still have to do it. Which is fine because it works for most people. It’s a good system but it does not work for everyone and clever work slides in between for those more aspirational.
        
        Let’s be honest, most people don’t even know what they would love to do and that is also fine because society is globally well equipped and structured in different degrees to make it fun for everyone outside the jobs.
        
        Fortunately, i have had experience with all varieties of this, therefore—> doing that you love is a blessing. ‘Actionable thinking’ is a huge part of it which feeds directly into implementing well and is a 24x7 job.
        
    
    —> “Your use of social media seems really distracting from work.” 
    
    Firstly, if your assessment of any project or myself is based on my social media activity rather than direct engagement/ conversation then that’s your fault. Only social media I use frequently is Twitter/X or Instagram for information and education + it all feeds into the current primary task of looking for resources to be able to actually focus on objective work. If you look at it as “addiction” it’s purpose based controlled action and fortunately good at noise cancellation. 🎧

    —> “What’s your criteria of sharing issues based content in any capacity on social media?” 
    
    To be bluntly honest, I don’t form an opinion on anything until consideration of all the facets of any given subject, especially, any topics dealing with social issues rather than personal issues. Because, if a problem is personal then it’s more specific and easier to address—> that also has to do with how the issue is presented.
    
    For examples—> if people from 10 different religion or any region simply share that they have planted a tree, i will share all 10 tweets. So on…
    
    If the person posting some content is genuinely trying to shine a light on a given subject from all facets as a means of seeking solution or they are trying to form an opinion based on a particular perspective to start a debate—> that is not to ascertain the good or bad of their opinion, but the details of the matter. All issues can not lead to instant solutions, therefore, informed debate is important, but debates themselves are not medium of information—> they are to help form an opinion based on the insights of the debaters from the information already available to the users/ readers/ audience/ participants.
    
    It’s not “people pleasing” when I don’t want to unfairly upset anyone to realise that an important piece of information was left unconsidered. For example—> human rights, women rights and freedom, animal rights, environment conservation are issues that require unconditional consideration and support without any kind of bias. Though, it’s not necessary that all content made around these issues is non biased, especially when also dealing with sensitive topics like politics and identity. Therefore, i try not to share any such content without consumption because I have done that in the past and it was not fair on many grounds. If specific content mentions a friend or acquaintance in some capacity then ideally I like addressing it personally and directly with them before sharing, even at the cost of my own benefit. Symbolism is not a consideration.
    
    Humour is humour—> no rules apply there unless if the joke can draw attention of irrationality. It’s a joke made to be laughed at, maybe some self reflection, any other analysis of humour is irrational.
    
    > Consider this by Ricky Gervais—> Please stop saying "You can't joke about anything anymore". You can. You can joke about whatever the fuck you like. And some people won't like it and they will tell you they don't like it. And then it's up to you whether you give a fuck or not. And so on. It's a good system.
    > 
    
    As long as they tell you “they don’t like it” with civility of a joke itself. Golden rule applies here as well.

    —> “What do you have to say to those who are threatened by more technology?”
    
    Usually, this mindset is a mark of people used to and relying on pre defined processes built by ancestors without truly understanding anything. They are filled with pompous ego and envy believing manipulation to be virtuous while relying on the very technology that they belittle for every aspect of their life.
    
    The whole reason our ancestors made these processes is because they knew that future generations will be filled with fools, but probably they underestimated the foolishness. There is nothing like “less” or “more” technology—> would it make sense for a horse to pull an electric car? Or to drive on rocky terrains rather than on smooth roads? Would you have airplanes that can only take off but not land? Or piece of land which can grow crops only once and you have to look for new land every season? No. I can do this whole day but have better things to think about unlike the pessimists.
    
    No one is forcing anyone to use technology, people can chose how much tech they use based on their requirements in daily life or desire to stay up to date which has nothing to do with development of technology or its use by others.
    
    Wanting to use mobile phones for everything you like but lamenting about use cases that others use it for is known as hypocrisy. There is a wide spectrum of use cases for everything and relative filters which also keep improving. It’s important to understand that all technology improves over time and it’s not perfect right away—> the microwave was not invented at the same time our ancestors discovered fire for cooking food! Here’s a fax machine that can solve all of your problems, we should have just stopped there itself 📠

    —> “What are your views on healing?” 
    
    We are always continuously healing and at the same time need to understand that our experiences could have been widely different. Compassion is probably the more important aspect that allows us to respect all our differences while still optimistically functioning for our own selves but also for mankind’s future.❣️
    
    —> “Are you against Fin Tech or Banks?” 
    
    Not at all. Giving feedback that can improve my experience as a customer is not “disliking” or a “revolt.” I like things inc my experiences being simple, fair but optimally useful and all thoughts are shared from that perspective📱

    —> “Do you own any crypto currency or what is your history with Crypto?”
    
    The only time I ever bought any crypto was Bitcoin in December of 2021 for INR 5000. Though, i did come across the Bitcoin white paper in 2010 while looking for privacy solutions to protect my work and also self volunteered to “solve” Facebook revenue problems on my own by restructuring its revenue model based on blockchain like mechanism. But I did not think of Crypto from the perspective of making an app or trading, being an astute observer, trying to stay out of all trouble at that time and till quite recently. 
    
    I used technical topic or subjects to write about in fictional screenplays, though, did get interested in exploring the business side of blockchain after spotting underlining potential because of the research for the screenplay. Tried putting together a project in 2017 between a company called Amtrak India that only does projects in collaboration or initiated by Government of India/ Federal Branches and a company based in Powai, Mumbai already developing blockchain project as a Government of India funded pilot. Though nothing concrete happened there and I moved on due to differences with Amtrak India.
    
    My interest in the business side of blockchain and crypto reignited in mid to late 2021 as Cinemas were non operational and other several unnecessary roadblocks made it difficult to make any progress in that domain. After an year of research for practical implementation as a start up product which continued till mid to late 2022 and led to some key insights, had to take a step back as the crypto industry imploded and by then I had found more familiar interest in AI. 
    
    That’s pretty much it. 
    
    —> “What are your political views?” 
    
    Not affiliated with any political party and want to stay away from the practice of everyday politics. Political science as a subject or history lessons are interesting and essential to understanding the workings of our nation and the world. 
    
    Giving constructive feedback to our government is not political though I try not to have any “coffee table conversations” re politics unless to add nuance in conversations.
    
    Those in politics will always see everything as political as that is one of the function of their job even though not the primary job description, more power to them for knowing their responsibilities and doing their actual jobs. 
    
    Politics as a job is also image driven which is again fine for those who have to do that within reason. It makes no sense to connect anything I do, say, write with any kind of political manoeuvring or any political person or political party in particular unless stated specifically.
    
    I do believe in the importance of having multiple political parties as part of a robust democratic system. Evolving Capitalism is the only true solution for this amazing human civilisation composed of forever everlasting great nations as recognised by the United Nations. Communism and socialism are bullshit. 
    
    I am always interested in the progress of India/ Bharat 🇮🇳 and the human civilisation but don’t think indulging in everyday politics is necessary to contribute. 
    
    I am interested in Global and ever lasting peace on planet earth, but have absolutely NO self interest in any Geo political issues whatsoever. 
    
    Politics working as a hurdle for specific interests rather than an enabler will be challenged in courts and public forums as per the constitution to set things right. Jai Hind.
    
    Absolutely no one is authorised to personally represent me inside any political party or take part in any political discourse on my behalf. That does not mean I personally can’t be friends, associate or acquaintance with a member of any political party. Please consider kindness and peace before politics 🤍
    
    —> “How come you never voted in the general elections of India/ Bharat?”
    
    Voting is our primary right in a democracy and should be exercised with ease, period. 
    
    I got my first job away from home in Mumbai just when I was turning 20 y.o in 2007 and was in London during the first eligible elections to be able to vote in 2009. Then in 2014, i did want to vote but my name was not in the electoral list apparently. Mom and Dad were delivered their voter ID card at home and I don’t recall if my brother got his card then but he definitely did not vote.
    
    I did try to enquire through did not go out of my way either as was not getting any satisfactory answer to begin with. I could not understand if I have a passport, a PAN Card at that time than why did my name was not in the electoral list?
    
    Later, there was a way to register online to receive your voter ID card, I did register more than once using that link from the best of my memory though still no voter ID card was ever delivered. There was a lot of talk in the political circles on TV News about Aadhar card not being useful so i took my time but when it was clear that it is useful, safe and mandatory, i got the Aadhar made but even after that my name was not in the electoral list and I did not receive a voter’s ID card in 2019. At that time, i was again travelling within India and there was no provision to vote remotely. 
    
    I don’t understand why it’s such a puzzle to be able to vote?! If one has a passport, a PAN Card, Aadhar card then why a voter’s ID is not automatic? I do understand that remote voting is not an easy process and could be really expensive to implement in a country of more than billion people but hopefully the whole process of voting could be made easier to exercise and transparent to take our great democracy to even greater heights.
    
    If i had a chance to vote at those times then I would have voted based on the prime ministerial candidates which is a mistake on my part based on the established system of our democracy but the local candidates usually don’t have any practical plan to improve local facilities. These local candidates have further community representatives, most of whom i know are drunk alcoholics working more as mediators using different kind of force and farce rather than any actual skills to make people’s lives better. There is no immediate accountability for these local self professed netas and god knows what happens to every 1 rupee when its starts its journey from the RBI to the people of India. Of course, now we know electoral bonds was a scam in the name of political donations.
    
    Jai Hind. Bharat Mata Ki Jai! 🇮🇳
    
    As an educated person even, though I am 12th fail 😅, I don’t want to vote rhetoric of a local representative but actual program and the process they are going to follow to make it happen without corruption. This should benefit local development from the farmer to the last person without bias. Slogans mean nothing to me and come across as shallow rubbish used to manipulate people.
    
    Sometimes you have to pick a leader due to lack of good choices. One can’t say who they are going to vote for in the coming elections but in the previous elections where i was eligible to vote being citizen of the great democratic Republic of India, this is who I would have voted for progress and development of democratic systems + the economy of India/ Bharat being the only factors—>
    
    2009–> Dr. Manmohan Singh
    
    2014—> Shri Narendra Modi
    
    2019—> Shri Narendra Modi
    
    In 2004 when I was not eligible, I would have voted for Late Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee
    
    I still don’t have a voter ID card by the way, as my name is never in the local electoral lists.
    
    —> “What about other world democracies?”
    
    I do follow world affairs, to have a fresh mental model of our global civilisation. It’s useful in writing stories, making films, technology is a global phenomenon. I have been studying financial markets as well, though not trading, but it’s about keeping your hand on the pulse of the global trade when you do dive in with enough money, rather than starting uninformed.
    
    Like everyone else, I do casually follow 🇺🇸 American Politics. Obviously, can’t vote but have been an admirer of President Abraham Lincoln, President Barrack Obama, Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
    
    I was rooting for President Joe Biden in 2020 elections which was more than wanting to see Mr. Donald Trump out of the Oval Office. I read a detailed story somewhere about the Biden family trying to save one of their sons suffering from a fatal health condition and felt attachment based on compassion. Joe seemed genuinely a good person and someone worth having the responsibility of becoming president of USA. In fact, i was hoping for him to run for the Oval office in 2016 as well.good. 
    
    Aunt Kamala has secured the spot to run for the White House against Mr. Trump. Being American means to be a free thinker, first and foremost. To carry the spirit of cultures from across the world to enhance the American spirit. To not hold back your steps in fear of some vague dogmas. I’ve been following aunt Kamala’s career since her time as a prosecutor in California. It’s true, sometimes she does come across as uninformed or opinionated, but she’s always eager to learn and improve her understanding to make better decisions. This is an important quality that any head of state shall poses—> accountability + responsibility. Her journey from an aspirational candidate to becoming leader of the free world is a coming of age story that’ll inspire girls + boys everywhere in the world regardless of race, religion or nationalities. I am looking forward to seeing her as the next president of USA. 
    
    Addition of Coach Walz strengthens the team in a strong place. I never heard about Tim before, but he seems like a role model with his career in the armed forces, other than being a governor, coach and a teacher. He brings that cool coach energy that is not only great for the campaign, but would also be useful in the White House and international diplomacy. 
    
    More so, Prosecutor Harris and Coach Walz, complement each other really well to deliver. I am looking forward to them upholding American values of learning, upgrading, but sticking to their promises. Future of democracies might depend on doing the right thing. God bless America 🗽 🙏🏽
    
    But Elon Musk supports Mr. Trump, and you seem like a hUge musk admirer. Why this contradiction?
    
    I can’t speak for Elon, of course. However, as much as I know him, the differences with the Democratic Party are due to lack of proper communication or logical reasoning from the democrats, where he felt slighted. It’s just my personal opinion, if the democrats spend more time listening to Elon’s concerns, rather than dictating, then there’s a chance of forming better understanding on key issues. 
    
    Regardless, as individuals we can hold different political opinion, and still be friends. lol. 😅 🤷🏽‍♂️
    
    Since, i used to live in The 🇬🇧 UK and happen to read the news papers, that’s where I found interest in the political sciences. There it’s much more complicated than USA. I think Prime Minister David Cameron was doing a fine job of rebuilding the economy but Brexit was just a disastrous decision even though based on a referendum. 
    
    Miliband brothers interested me for a while but they never seemed to get their act together…..which is a familiar dynamic. I even had some hopes from Boris Johnson but my god 🤦🏾‍♂️
    
    Rishi Sunak was dignified in his term as prime minister, and even when leaving office.
    
    Let’s see how Sir Keir Starmer goes about his term as prime minister.
    
    I was also extremely casually following Russia’s politics but would not like to comment due to the ongoing war which I do NOT support at all. I am only in favour of unconditional peace and dialogue based conflict resolution via diplomacy. I do hope for some near term resolution to restore peace in that region as Language of love > clash of egos. 
    
    Democracies are built in peace, rather than in war, just something to remember for those in support of always evolving rule based democratic order. Peace is vital for progress. 
    
    —> “What are your religious views?” 
    
    Secular and NON religious. I respect all religions based on an individual’s right to practice their belief without imposing it on others in any shape, way or form. I respect all local cultures even when driven by religion and consider culture as an important aspect of keeping the fabric of rational society together. I grew up around Hinduism and am familiar with all its aspects inside out, therefore don’t have to rely on other people’s interpretation. I respect that history and associated institutions.
    
    Don’t like other labels either though believe we are insignificant in the scheme of things and yet the power of love makes us whole. If you like to call the Universe as God, I am a believer in “God is same everywhere” Leo Tolstoy 💛🩷❤️🧡💚🩵💙💜🤎🖤🩶🤍
    
    —> “Tell us one regret that you turned into a lesson and practice.” 
    
    I was trying to make a short animated film in 2009 in open + lose collaboration with an animation company in London. We shot some emails in trying to find funding for the film and got a vague reply from someone at BBC’s Olympics committee. A highly enthusiastic 21 years old—> I started development without any financial commitment by the studio or BBC or anyone, even got a Concept Artists on board who was as enthusiastic as myself—> she left her life in Germany and relocated to London partly based on the belief that we are already working out of an established animation company and will find funding but we did not even after lot of efforts + hustling. It took me a while to realise her predicament but i was already living on scraps so could not compensate for the amazing work. Ever since, have never hired anyone without money in the bank—> based on loose associations or non commitments, there had been other such experiences as well which fortunately only affected myself because of that lesson turned into practice. 💷
    
    —> “What is your sexual orientation?” 
    
    I am heterosexual straight men with an average size working, normally working and active D**K that is only interested in women—> 😘 Anna Chukova 🤗 specifically. Also, I believe in an individual’s right to practice their sexuality without imposing on others in any shape, way or form or being subjected to judgment by others 🧬
    
    —> “Do you consider yourself a scientist or want to become a scientist?” 
    
    Does one needs a label to build something of value? No and… no. Zero % interest in taking the academic route 📑
    
    —> “Are you interested in pursuing any stage of formal education?”
    
    Absolutely Not interested in pursuing formal education anywhere. I already have an MA acquired in 2009 from Royal Holloway, University of London.
    
    —> “How are you vulnerable? Give us an example?”
    
    I am always open for fair and direct negotiations to reach a progressive + rational solution, also known as positive sum games 😎

        Those are X ray glasses to spot bullshit, can also smell and hear it out. Rationality is not based on what works best for either party but what’s required to get the best out of any situation in the present, for the future.
        
    
    —> “Give us a really brief bio of yourself, really brief.” 
    
    I was born in New Delhi and raised in an industrial town on its outskirts known as Faridabad in the state of Haryana alongside an older brother. An ‘out of time’ place which could have existed anywhere in the world going through interesting cultural evolutions and changes in real time 😁…wide open spaces at that time with a capitalist vibe in its nature—> it was India but kind of global with neighbours from all different Indian subcontinent cultural backgrounds—> even has a golf course! Along with Doordarshan + Bollywood, on the TV, Cinema and Digital side I also grew up with America 😀 though never been there. Moving is in the nature of the being and it’s important to keep your thinking clear + horizons broad—> so I have been wanting to from a young age and particularly fascinated by Bombay—> initially got to be there while working for an amazing company doing Hollywood VFX with greyish but kind people 🤣. It truly became ‘Fictional City of Bombay’ when I met Anna ❤️ Tver, Russia. Also got to experience even broader range of cultures, situations and people while studying + living in and around London like a darker side of greyish 😂 friend and my ex boss who built a thriving construction company there at the age of 64 . Some might look at my experiences as tough, inadequate or bad decisions—> I just find it all tremendously fascinating 🍿 and appreciate everyone even those not mentioned while travelling through my own shades of grey 🙏

        Some people not only have a habit but unnecessary urge to put negativity into everything. If positivity and honesty seems to you like “political correctness” then so be it. I am not personally interested or in the business of unnecessarily debating with anyone. 
        
        —> my life is not for everyone, it’s not recommended unless you want to make your kind of music, unless you want to be out there among the stars, unless you love with an open heart and not afraid to start again with lessons but no regrets.

    Almost all scholars in religion or other institutions have written about this subject as in the Bhagavad Gita. Quotes that are not mentioned here are not omission, can’t put every quote from everyone here. Read the above again and calm down 🙏
    
    —> “Talk about anger?”
    
    I still have to meet a person who does not get angry and are healthy. Getting angry and expressing it peacefully in the moment or with assertiveness or accepting that you momentarily misjudged the situation is actually better and healthy compared to keeping the anger inside of you to show that you don’t get angry at all but taking it out in manipulative ways later.
    
    No, I do not get angry often—> i won’t get angry if you make a mistake. Primarily, i get angry when people are purposely imposing a scenario or are forcing an issue without listening due to their insecurities which can also be attributed as bullying and my patience for that runs thin if I am hungry or thirsty. Otherwise, i lose patience when the same bullying is repeated—> even then it is addressed on the spot, only through assertive words, always non-violently/ peacefully. I don’t keep agendas against people for 10 years or even beyond 1 day, actually not even beyond that moment unless it’s repeated. Don’t want to keep my energy spent or focused on that as there are so many wonderful things to think about and beauty to be absorbed in the world 🫵🏽
    
    Can you bring up any record of me being non violent? There was an incident when a semi drunk person purposefully non stop shouted and cursed at me starting approx 3am till approx 530am at a hotel while i was only sitting in the cafe, doing work. I did not shout back or curse at him but kept typing, writing, finished the work and sent it. Then, shook hands with him the same morning while having a peaceful conversation about his bad manners. There have been many incidents like these where I have taken the most peaceful route again and again 🤍 
    
    —> “What is your criteria for general purpose collaboration or acquaintance?”
    
    Honesty and transparency. That’s the minimum. I get turned off by dishonest and manipulative people because there is no basic foundation to that kind of collaboration. We might continue to keep in touch sometimes if I see scope of you being honest or in case I am interested in your lies. 
    
    Being honest does not mean “you never lie” but do you have the character to say the truth? That also applies to those trying to give specific advice—> if you don’t even know yourself, what are you doing? You don’t know me. Stop judging like it’s not speculative at all, if you are super confident about your wrong virtues, there’s likely no foundational honesty in or around you.
    
    —> “what do you consider absolute waste of time?” 
    
    People trying to prove their point by enforcing their point when they are actually being ignorant—> hive mind thinking or cynics with “trying to be right at any cost” mentality. It’s not so much any behaviour that’s particularly bothersome but trying to persist or impose to test its outside acceptance or justification—> like “a mission to tune someone” based on your own bias rather than self acceptance + self approval via direct feedback based understanding is unproductive and a waste of resources 🦠
    
    —> “Have you considered being a Stand up comic rather?”
    
    I have in fact thought about that on many occasions in theory but never implemented practically 🤣 🤣🤣
    
    Why does fun needs to be “professional?” Humour is an effect of being good at other things actually. If I can bring joy to anyone in anyway, thats awesome! Though, like with other things, if you want to pay me for being funny, contact directly 😅
    
    —> “But you are “always kidding” and sometimes serious conversations are essential. What if you make an awkward joke in an important meeting?”
    
    Everything written here is minus negative or positive emotions, it’s neutral lightness. Also, I am not into pranks, only regular humour…..you know like sarcasm, irony, poor sounding jokes…that stuff.
    
    I indulge in serious discourse when a serious topic/subject is being discussed with ‘sincerity and honesty’ which has nothing to do with being sad. Lightness and joy are essential for a positive sum mindset which can elevate conversations through unrealised options in every situation rather than being trapped by joylessness, envy and greed.
    
    —> “Do you have a hidden agenda or cause or ideology?”
    
    No. Other than being able to help bring good and prosperity by building products, stories and space ships. I do have perspectives and feedback about general course of things and of course there is self interest as well…🤘
    
    —> “Are you against governments or established structures?”
    
    No. But who is satisfied with their government or any government? You can’t make everyone happy and that is not even the job. Like everything else, even governments, organisational and supporting structures need updates to better serve the people—> so when I give my thoughts to improve these processes they are just that without any right/left or political bias. Yes, some of these opinions could be plain wrong, not thought out enough or without privileged/ classified information—> i admit if that is the case 🏛️
    
    A brief comment about private established structures—>
    
    letting people know about their own ignorance is not being against them but we have tied everything so strictly to branded reward points from generalised public opinion that even directly given informed feedback is taken as attack when someone is only trying to help💰
    
    —> “You have strong views on privacy, why?”
    
    Privacy is important because not everyone is equipped to understand everything we do all the time but that does not stop people from making unnecessary judgments based on their half, biased or sometimes totally wrong POV.
    
    It’s important from a spiritual perspective to spend quality time alone to construct better thoughts. Listening to gibberish has not helped anyone.
    
    It’s creatively rewarding to curate thoughts without outside influence or judgement.
    
    It’s crucial from a business perspective to keep tight hold of your data to prevent competition of any kind from taking advantage of the hard work. Thats’s how I started researching about privacy and security, to find ways to share my ideas and developed work with third parties while protecting financial interests.
    
    No, I do not use VPN to watch porn. I don’t watch porn. Do you understand how the World Wide Web works? If you knew, then you won’t be asking why online and digital privacy is important. There are plenty of information on the web itself to educate yourself on this topic.
    
    I do think law enforcement should have access to public or private data of citizens but through a proper legal process because law enforcement is also made of people like you and me or in some cases working for corrupt politicians or being manipulated by powerful corporates. Just like we need law, we also need to make sure those working to maintain the law are also following the rules and don’t have a free rein on citizen‘s data. There needs to be proper channels to access data rather than loopholes, to downplay misuse by all sides.
    
    —> “What is your problem with taking photographs or videos? What are you hiding from?”
    
    I have no problems in taking candid photographs or videos when I am politely asked first or when I am being compensated/ paid. For the right price, you can make me stand in front of a live camera for hours. 
    
    Photos or videos for self promotion are fine and you can find them on my social media.
    
    Sometimes one has to take these kind of photos to be “nice” and sociable which is not a judgment of anyone else + people should do what they like of course, it’s only a personal thing—> just find it repulsive to show off beyond purpose or being a “fame whore” term coined by Kristen Stewart to describe people who lose their mind over fame 🤮
    
    —> “What are your thoughts about fame?” 
    
    It’s an important part of society’s function and should be used responsibly. There are different types of fames of course—> don’t believe in chasing fame for the sake of it, at the same time not against anyone taking that route. A famous person should be able to contribute, give back in thought or action as per their capacity and at the same time should not be forced either 📺 🤳
    
    —> No action or mistake is fatal unless it has irreversible negative impact on people’s lives and those are rare cases. Even though, open to all probabilities that arise from life, if you have an open mind to transparency then let’s solve some problems together?

    No. To repeat, staying open to peaceful consideration of infinite probabilities in life to make informed choices 🌅 
    
    —> “Are you waiting for a miracle?” 
    
    Is that what we are calling honesty, transparency and —> resources to build these days? Than, yes. By the way, same could be said about the people expecting anything practical + useful without the said “miracle.” 🌤️
    
    —> “Are you going to build based on the open tabs or bookmarks in your browser?”
    
    I read a lot of stuff available openly to build knowledge but have an actual product theory unlike some perverts looking for shortcuts by sneak peaking into unpublished work. Being ethical and having a positive sum mindset is important for doing useful science + creativity + capitalism rather than looking to get ahead for the sake of taking credit.
    
    —> “You haven’t ever done any real world work, you know?”
    
    Among other things listed here, my side job for 8 years was in the construction industry. Sure, I was not actually laying bricks, still it was work enabling real construction and more—> pretty real. Lots of paper work, dealing with extremely diverse set of people and their grievances to get them to pay without hassle while “my boss” was trying to sue anyone in sight, therefore, a lot of legal work as well 😅. 
    
    Also, movies are something people watch in the real world and not in dreams, every stage of the process to make them is quite real. Even the projects in different domains that in the end did not work out involved dealing with real people and then deciding to not deal with them 😂 were also real decisions. 
    
    Let me tell you something, even to sit and hear people talk but to decipher the bullshit for reality and building fictional ideas or tech applications out of client speak is much more than real in terms of doing extremely hard work. Not for everyone used to following regular pre defined processes. Think about it 🤠
    
    All you need to do is read the track record essays.
    
    —> “What is your problem with non-direct communication?
    
    We all do it because we love a mess and making everything more difficult + complicated than it’s supposed to be. Stop being an asshole because people like you who want polite, direct and open minded communication are assholes according to us and people who want manipulation, unnecessary power and issues are just pure awesome.” People use manipulative behaviour because they are afraid of being wrong, embarrassed in the moment or indeed to gain power. Everything around us and everything we do is to decrease the complications, not increase them—> being manipulative in any way, shape or form leads to more complications even when it seems easy and you can read any old, even religious text to attest this simple fact. It’s a bug and not a feature of any society or group or person who considers themselves virtuous. Anyone holding onto anything is also capable and encouraged of admitting without prejudice or embarrassment for objective progress 🙏
    
    —> “Do you want to copy Steve Jobs?” 
    
    You cannot copy a person or their life—> which lived with their values is a greater achievement rather than any material processions. No, I do not aspire to copy anyone. For that matter…admiration is a function of learning and not hero worshiping or copying 
    
    - Additional Context
        
        Not to be confused with “trying to be a saint” or “not wanting any material things.” Of course…material things play part in making our lives simpler and increase efficiency of the mind space…productivity…but it’s not about wanting “because what this or that person has” or wanting “because I want to show or impress.” Functional materialism to enable freedom of choice…if that’s a thing…well that’s my thing at least.
        
    
    —> “Are you doing this for legacy?” 
    
    Do we remember the name of every dinosaur that achieved something? That’s a joke. Take it easy. Of course we are more evolved…..🤔…yes, definitely more evolved. As an artist, I explore both inner and outer worlds…therefore doing things for the fun of discovery and contribution besides to live with my values knowing that ultimately we are branches of the same tree…part of the universe…the nature 🌌

    —> “Do you just want to use investors money because you think it grows on money plant?” 
    
    No, I am absolutely aware about their predicaments and the reasons of their apprehensions. At the same time, the proposals presented for any project are as objective as it can be without bias of the situation because in the long term thats inconsequential. Risk has been made apparent with no attempts to conceal any aspects other than protecting the IP 🏄
    
    —> “You told someone that you don’t eat/ drink this or that but then ate/drunk it…how can you do that?! We are in constant shock!” 
    
    I eat + primarily have only ever eaten vegetarian food and eggs, but have not banned anything. Not liking something only means not consuming it frequently but I also like trying different types of foods all the time…you never know what might strike the taste buds unless you try. Also, like anything else I don’t impose my opinion re food on others…everyone should be able to eat/drink according to their own choice and own responsibility 🧑‍🍳
    
    —> “Do you criticise Bollywood or Indian television because you’re envious or “because your dal nahi galli” huh?” 
    
    The feedback is from my perspective and taste…also because along with the mainstream we are capable of making films or content that are explorative in the spirit of both inner and outer diversity while still appealing to the world. Yes, there are people trying to do that and hopefully more of that will be enabled which can also seep into the mainstream. Storytelling is not a template but it’s fine if that’s only my opinion. Indian music and dances are great…I enjoy…you can’t compare Art with others or based on time spent…those are commercial considerations. Satyajit Ray is one of the finest director of all time. Sure, my sensitivities are more attuned to global content without much bias other than originality of vision + narrative….here are some of my fav Bollywood movies—> Mera Naam Joker, Chupke Chupke(1975), Sholay, Mr. India, Hera Pheri(2000), Khabi Haan Khabi Na, Hum Apke Hai Kaun, Jane Bhi Do Yaro, Jo Jita Wohi Sikandar, Andaaz Apna Apna, Vaastav, Hum Dil de Chuke Sanaam, Border, Gadar 1, Jhankaar Beats, Omkara, Taare Zameen Par, Dil Chahta Hai, Bahuballi 1, Chameli, DDLJ. Tv Shows—> Flop Show by Jaspal Bhatti, Dekh Bhai Dekh, Circus, Fauji, Byomkesh Bakshi, Vikram and Bhaital….among others. 🎞️

    —> “Do you think giving all of this clarification will make your life better?” No? 🤣…well 🖖
    
    This is about ‘not being entitled to your random opinion and imposing it as judgement onto others’—> nothing is a matter of random public opinion or preaching. Even any non random opinion is filtered to applicable usefulness. All noise is blocked and attempts to sabotage in any way, shape or form are peacefully neutralised. Don’t confuse any of this with “unfriendliness” or “unpleasantness” I like talking to strangers, say ‘Hi’ in case you spot me in the neighbourhood—> we shall try to keep it simple and real 🙃 🔆 
    
    —> “What are your thoughts about elder care?”
    
    I grew up carrying for elders. They want to be able to take care for themselves. If you are not living your life well then you can’t really care for anyone. If you have personal and professional goals then you empower people at any stage of life to be self responsible and fill in the gaps as required. Maintaining relationships is not a dependable aspect of physical carrying—> which also does not mean to neglect when personal care is required.
    
    —> “What is your problem with the system? Why do you keep talking about it? That’s governments job.”
    
    By the people, of the people, for the people and my own addition “with the people.” Systems don’t change on their own. Government is made up of older people mostly who are set in their patterns or even the younger ones with tired old patterns. I was not particularly talking about governing system when developing movies or VR/AR. This primarily started with practical research in blockchain and Artificial Intelligence because both domains will have major impact on governing systems, these will be the primary technologies future systems will incorporate. Therefore, you can’t and shouldn’t refrain from thinking, researching, talking and developing systems of any kind as long as it makes sense. But if you lack common sense or foundational knowledge then just do your thing and let me do mine.
    
    —> “You can be contradictory sometimes which makes it difficult to put a pin on your views.”
    
    I think objectively, it’s not contradictory for the sake of being contradictory. If you block your mindset to only a single pattern of thinking then you will find it hard pressed to think originally. For example—> I am totally in favour of political systems being democratic and electoral but that does not mean you cannot improve those systems. Those who are only looking to take advantage rather than improve are restricted in their mindset.
    
    Another example—> if I am listening to a crypto podcast that does not mean I am working on a crypto project or I am Satoshi! lol. It’s not about way ward thinking or sticking to whatever you want to be true but analysing and improving which takes a lot of work in considering logical perspectives.
    
    We live in a world where if you support LGBTQ as a straight single person then you are unnecessarily labelled gay but if you don’t support then you are labelled homophobe or bigoted. You can’t win over trolls because their whole point is to find ways to troll like politicians and their supporters.
    
    If you support Israel, it does not mean you are against a peaceful Palestine state that can coexist alongside with Israel but without harbouring terrorist mindset. Why is this controversial?
    
    If you say that Israel should be careful in its conduct during action in Gaza which means following human rights and making sure humans have food + water, it does not mean you are against Jewish people, you can’t just win on the field when you need to win hearts for long term peace. Why is this controversial?
    
    If you say that we need transparency and process based order in matters of governance so that no issue small or big becomes a matter of any individual’s intuition or ego. What’s controversial in that?
    
    How is saying that elections should be free and fair is supporting any particular political party or person? If you can’t have free and fair elections then you can’t do anything free and fair from that point onwards. Whats controversial in that?

What’s controversial about that?
    
    What’s controversial about being aware about ‘balance’ in all matters of life?

    —> “Do you often say half truths?”
    
    What does that even mean?! A third person’s lack of understanding about a subject does not define the truth.
    
    “Complete truth” is not that suits narrative of some random person. If you want to understand any situation in more depth than contact the concerned directly. Truth is not told ‘on purpose’ but for clarity between those involved. This term seems divisive to force a perspective for the sake of starting an argument.
    
    —> “What is your problem with Elites?”
    
    I have no problem with anyone in particular. Being an “elite” is not an identity, not a sensible one, anyway. 
    
    Speaking radical truth about systems comes with offending people who benefit from flawed systems if they do not want to improve and don’t appreciate honesty. They have pseudo intellectual excuses like “this is not the right time for honesty.”
    
    Capitalist economies are made for people to make money, its fine to make money as long as you do not come in the way of new ideas by promoting a protectionist mindset and become a hurdle in improving the system that can benefit more and more people. Those who think of themselves as “elites” have low intellectual capacity, therefore, low self worth and wider radius of envy. You can have a lot of money or power and still not conduct yourself with an “elitist” mindset.
    
    Anyone into economic protectionism in a capitalist economy even with lot of money or power is a socialist by mindset and for the 100000th time—> socialism failed, everything is working because global economy adapted principles of capitalism. 
    
    Those promoting socialist agendas within capitalist systems or averse to evolving capitalist systems are socialist elites with capital and not bright because their core thinking is unsustainable—> hypocrites.
    
    As writer, software and AI developer, film maker its natural to talk and build systems that are closer to solving the ground truth, rather than exist in the bubble of “elites.”
    
    —> What are your views about transgenders?
    
    I don’t think about this topic much. We are not talking about pop culture image of gender stereotypes here, but only about biological science—> men are men, women are women, transgender are transgender. There should be no discrimination against anyone based on their gender. Anyone practising their gender without it being imposed on others is fair. As long as people accept themselves, external validation should not be the main focus of these subjects. I understand it’s difficult for many transgender people, we shall practice compassion and empathy to reduce discrimination in all facets of society.
    
    —> What are your views about woke culture?
    
    Cancelling people is wrong and ridiculous. Wokism is the most stereotypical form of commonality practice to control free thoughts, masked as equality imposed by self appointed social justice groups, actually driven by incentives. It’s as prevalent on the ‘right’, as on the ‘left,’ though on the ‘right’ they have their own masks to impose on free thinking. We should focus on making communication better—> honesty over incentivised hypocrisy. Humour is humour. You know when someone is having fun, and when someone is insulting you, they are not the same unless you want to confuse it. Controlling people at the “thought level” is a zero sum game, we need to communicate with others for progress, rather than impose in any form. 
    
    Also, if someone is offended, they need to realise and accept it being a personal emotion which has nothing to do with another person. They should seek clarity with direct and honest communication, rather than offensive action.

- Additional Context
    
    There’s a scene in Mad Men where Conrad Hilton after a chance meeting with Don Draper at Roger Sterling’s party randomly calls him for an in person conversation to ask his opinion about the latest print advertisement for Hilton Hotels. It’s a big deal as Conrad Hilton is a multi millionaire in the 60’s America and about to be featured on the cover of the Time Magazine.
    
    Don declines to which Conrad looks disappointed.
    
    Hilton—> “Don, i thought this was friendly.”
    
    Draper—> “what do you want me do Connie? It’s my job.” 
    
    Hilton—> “I want you to give me one for free”
    
    Don provides his quick, though profound insight for free and after that they get into business.
